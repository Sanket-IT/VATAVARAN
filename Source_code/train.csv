0,"@united See? We were told repeatedly that the pilot was Late Flight and kept getting Late Flightr.  After we boarded, there was a defibrillator issue."

2,@united that's right- with an overnight Miami.
2,@united Have clients with an 11 hr layover at IAH (during the day). Will they have to claim &amp; recheck luggage. Or will it be taken care of?

0,@united @UCtraveladvisor - I would have loved to respond to your website until I saw the really long form. In business the new seats are bad
0,@united A refund and flight vouchers or another flight on a different airline at your expense for today. 8 hour drive is very inconvenient

2,@united thanks again for your concern. I will contact customer care upon our return from Australia.

0,@United  My bag is still in Colo Springs. I am disabled and have to search an unfamiliar airport and look for my bag. Not a good outcome
0,@united Shame that there's no flex to tickets transfer rules.  Even calling from Neurosurgery ICU isn't enough!
0,@united No. Denver said they don't handle baggage that made it to Colo. Springs.  They gave me an 800 number to call. No help there either.

0,@united What is your phone number. I can't find who to call about a flight reservation.
0,"@united well, you can't fix me missing my buddies 30th bday because of negligence but you can attempt to make up for it."
0,"@united why am I to believe they will help when customer service couldn't? Like I said, I want a number to someone who can fix what you did."
0,@united they helped me at the baggage service desk.  Said bc TSA screening was down in FLL not all bags made it but bag will be in EWR @ 12
0,@united Mobile boarding pass disappeared from phone while standing in line to board. Second time this week... Hmm.

2,"@united I guess that's too much ask, huh?"
0,@united but it's hard to stay upset at someone when they at least TRY to show remorse.
0,"@united By the way, a simple apology goes a long way, even if it's a hollow one. It's obvious that you don't care about me or my well-being,"
0,@united This isn't a one time thing either! It's a shocking pattern of repeated neglect and disrespect.
0,@united Fingers crossed &amp; its all intact. Very disappointed with this experience as before this we were actually saying we enjoyed using you
0,"@united It's an incredibly easy fix, but you would rather stay in your comfort zone, while I get forced out of mine."

0,@united Yeah sorry but there's always a problem with United. And you have an international reputation for having problems.
2,@united yall should probably work on that.
0,"@united but then again, maybe the @BBBNE_SD_KS_IA would care more to hear what went on than whoever listens to issues you caused"
0,@united I wonder if sharing all this on FB and insta would produce a number. 140 characters really limits my story telling.
0,@united so you're telling me there is no number to call after being left in an airport because of a negligent pilot and staff?

0,@united did  bags make it on the flight out of iad? second day without clothes is pretty inconvenient. We're pretty curious #UnitedAirlines
4,@united Every United flight between Saipan and Guam is an adventure! You never know when @CapeAir's old plane will be operational :)
0,@united hence why I've been asking for the customer service phone number so I can speak to a real person to get this sorted out
0,@united did our bags leave Washington yet? That would be convenient seeing as we left there a day ago. #UnitedAirlines #lostluggage
2,@united so if I'm flying 1st class just one leg to Chicago but not on my long flight to China am I still able to use the lounge in Chicago
0,"@united according to your DMs, I'm not owed a refund. please may I be provided with a contact number before I go to my bank to file claim"
0,@united about 3 hours ago. I need to work out if my bag can make it to my hotel here in time or if it will need to go elsewhere.
2,@united Okay thank you
2,@united I've filed the claim but have no way of calling for updates. Is there another way to do this?
0,@united pls properly train your agents. Requested to speak to 1k customer service &amp; was transferred to a dead end. Not even open at this hr
0,@united Thanks for remembering to load my bag onto my connecting flight. Oh wait you forgot. Iceland should be fun with no clothes....
4,@united Thank you for the cheese platter and abundance of entertainment options. Time just flew by.
0,"@united customer service is atrocious! You have disrupted my travel plans, you have lost my luggage and it is impossible to TALK TO A HUMAN"
0,@united terminal at MIA should have food open before 5am esp when there are flights at 6am. Two hours early like recommended. Can't eat.
0,@united it was UA flight 1001! Now I'm currently stuck in Portland because I missed my ride because of the 3 hour delay. #GetMartyHome
0,"@united has not responded to my various requests for contact numbers, does anyone know the UK customer service number for #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united how we looking on getting those bags to Lusaka
0,@united Could you update me on the suitcase please? The online and phone tracking told me nothing. I was told I'd have it back yesterday!
4,@united thank you. Been trying for two days to set this up.
0,@united just 1 last thing. U guys shouldn't be charging $ for drinks on a transatlantic flight
0,@united LHR arrival lounge #fail. Waited 20 mins for shower then left to find hotel. U know how many passengers u carry. Planning???
2,@united Any luck with finalizing my reservation? I DM'd information to you. Please let me know what else you need. Want to confirm ASAP. Thx
0,@united completed form but doubt it's any use. UA doesn't care. 6 day vacation will now be 5. Sure UA won't feel responsibility for that...
4,@united Definitely a compliment! I really thought my bag was lost after it was sent on to another airport. In the end I am a happy customer
4,@united thanx so much. You followed through and emailed me a $1000 ticket voucher. #unitedairlines they do care
4,"@united this will definitely be a trip to remember EWR-STI second of the season, first on seat 35A because it pays to be loyal!"
0,"@united nope, they told us it was time for them to go home and to sleep at the airport. Even though they assured us we would get a room..."
2,@united keep me updated. Let me know that the bags make the flight to j-burg
0,"@united ..back for the expensive holiday, he worked all year to pay for, that you RUINED! We want compensation &amp; his original case back!"
0,@united thanks United I understand that. But he would actually like his own bag back! What have you done with it?! He also wants the money..
0,"@united frankly worse customer service ever. Problems will happen, how you deal defines a company. Never again United."
0,"@united It's still a valid flight. Just seems strange to delay for Late Flight inbound crew,  7 hours from now, when the plane is already here."
0,@united Thanks for the lack of help and the canned response from the 1K desk!
0,@united   It's too bad UA has had another unforeseeable operational issue on my return flight.
2,@united I would like to know what's going on before his current flight lands.
0,@united if I pay you $25 and $35 for my luggage to be delivered when I arrive. Why should I have to wait 3 additional days for its delivery?
0,@united so 8 hotels for 32 people but feel like we are being held hostage because someone has our boarding passes so we can't leave! #FAIL
4,@united you are one great airline â¤ï¸
0,@united Outbound 2 bags 70 lbs bags Returning home 1 bag 50 lbs. What is your logic? And WHY? Am I writing to a Machine? Human HELP required
0,@lindaSWC @united:  We don't like to hear you had a poor experience. Please share details w/our Customer Care team http://t.co/HIsc4NdMgZ.
0,@united no Cancelled Flightn just left us to fend for ourselves when flt came in Late Flight. Getting runaround for 3 hrs. Each employee blaming  previous 1.
2,@united This is NOT a local UNITED number for Malaysia   0011 800-55558000. What is your local United Airlines here in Kuala Lumpur ( KUL )?
0,@united okay ase24766m. Find our luggage.
0,@united The agent that met us at the gate said any issues w/delays on UA1116 would have to be taken up online...
2,"@united I send you an urgent message via eservice@united.com.  BG0KWM   Narayanan. Please respond ASAP. Also, NO local United Tel # @ KUL"
2,@united thanks! Will you guys be getting the A380s anytime soon?
0,@united But they are not... lady one phone says its in tel aviv. Tel Aviv united says its in Newark. No one knows and I have nothing...
4,â€œ@united: @MelanieSpring We'll see what we can do. ^KNâ€ We are running! Most of this plane is running. Thanks for the help!
0,"@united yes, but still now answers. Many have not had their luggage for 3 days! Unacceptable!!"
0,@united what is that going to do for you? Nothing just like you always do
2,@united I sent in my feedback.  Thank you.
0,@united plus what about food? And taxis?
0,@united you are offering us 8 rooms for 32 people #FAIL
0,@united 32 people getting pretty tired about no action on solving the problem plus missing a day of vacation and skiing
0,@united The bright side would be keeping the promise that was made to me. Hope you're having a good night. Thanks.
2,@united yes I do.
0,@united I take back the comment about your team here working hard to help us A so far no solution for a hotel or food or anything #fail
0,@united on 4124 arriving two hours Late Flight into CLT. Now sitting on the tarmac while they move a plane from the gate. Unhappy customer.
0,@united airlines is the absolute worst. They have no idea what they are doing. #neveragain #UnitedAirlines
0,"@united Thanks; might want to fix this line: ""Our Customer Care team is currently responding to most inquiries within 7-10 business days."""
4,@united we just flew with United from AUS (Austin Bergstrom) to Cancun Intl. Best flight ever! The 737's are not too big... Not too small!
0,"@united it's frustrating, as a frequent flyer, loyal since Continental. Upgrade equals paying 3 times or more on top of purchase ticket."
2,@united Deep Vein thrombosis
0,"@united at its worse. Can't figure how to pack plane, screws up connectns then claims no hotl rooms in San Fran for stranded pax. Way to go!"
0,@united 4 passengers after a 2 hour delayed flight left with no hotel at the end of the night @ hou airport. Wtf??!! http://t.co/ZfqMpGXVS6
0,"Hey @united why does the flight from IAH to POS leave so Late Flight, and the one back to IAH so early? I rather get to POS earlier"
0,@united Lost bag process is broken. Agent promised they'd call &amp; hold my bag when found. Now they're waking me at 3am w/ delivery. #fail
0,@united the people at the counter have been very helpful. As you can see nobody is there. Flight to Austin 10:55 and still sitting here.
2,@united unfortunately still on the Tarmac at @fly2ohare and definitely missing my ride from @flypdx #GonnaBeALongNight
0,â€œ@united: @Darquenloveli We regret to hear this. Please let us know if you need assistance. ^KNâ€ I was finally able to secure my seat. Thx
2,@united what time does check in open for flight no UA80 from Manchester to Newark today ?
0,"@united good to know you will open the closed doors for ""premier passengers"" after safety briefings on delayed flights. #annoyed."
2,@united DM sent
0,@united yea get me to phoenix already. Delays all day with you people. It's bullshit.
0,"@united If it's any consolation, your staff was stellar. Just not the hour+ delays I encountered with every one of my 4 flights."
4,"@united flight ua3576, gate b1. And tell ray I somehow made it on to the 736 flight out of IAH and didn't have to wait for the 917 one. :)"
0,@united that's unfortunate. The @Tumitravel was an xmas gift and it looks like a razor ripped right through the front pocket in the picture
4,@united But thanks for asking
0,@united Lost bags. Cancelled Flightled flights. Delhi call centers. Poor United staff spread thin and stressed. You name it.
0,@united Yes. Doesn't make that mistake any less absurd. Doesn't change the fact that I'm very inconveniently missing my luggage tonight.
0,@united I'm constantly having challenges with upgrades &amp; charges. In order to prevent DVT I have to pay an addtl $180 http://t.co/xC6jQ70r7B
0,"@united In ORD, waited 20 min after crew members left before gate items came. Flight attendant sarcastically said good luck and walked away."
2,"@united Follow me back, please, and I'll happily DM you the link because I'd rather not share my travel plans publicly."
4,@united you too!
4,@united is my favorite airline.
0,@united seriously #fail on making strangers share a room
2,@united @luke_mcintosh68 nah you wouldn't
0,@united we needed them here asap. Will they make it on today's flight?
0,@united agent split up my reservation? Now can't Cancelled Flight and refund credit for 2wks? Why
2,@united Our vacation's going to be ruined w/ 3 days of rain. : ( The change fee for 2 of us is nearly cost of original flight. Can you help?
2,@united I sent the message. Let me know ASAP.
0,@united why would they make me share a room?
0,"@united tried calling too, but w/25 min phn wait means we'd miss options anyway"
0,@united can you ask your guys with flight 1146 to BWI to wait for us to get off a delayed flight from San Diego? Pretty please?
0,@united we're still waiting to find out your rep is working hard - most upset about having to wait to tomorrow pm to get to mammoth
0,"@united for an early flt, I think a call is appropriate. Yes, reviewed and nada avail until next day. Expect full refund"
2,"@united i understand, thanks"
0,"@united again I ask, who can I call to get this fixed? Tweeting me BS questions to stall only makes things worse. Phone number please."
0,@united Yo yo yo stuck on the tarmac for over 2 hours at @fly2ohare ... Going to miss my ride at @flypdx help please! #HelpImStuck #United
0,@united it's highly unprofessional for you to overbook a flight by 12 seats &amp;feel that I should rearrange my schedule for your mismanagement
0,"@united well, considering every agent before claimed they were unable to help with everything else, why waste more time to hear 'call corp'"
4,@united man I can't wait to book my ticket now! Thanks JP you're a life sabe
0,"@united Ice, which I totally understand. But when a large number of us are facing 15+ hours of time and overnight Cancelled Flightations it seems like"
0,@united flt 1249 Cancelled Flightled and I get email @3:30 AM? What happened to courtesy phn call? Had to book diff airline &amp; city
0,"@united tag numbers 0016 964012, 0016 964077, 0016 964078 - let's find these bags."
0,"@united better train your support staff with appropriate decorum, consider revisiting your terrible ""provide a death certificate' policy"
0,@united Well the bar is set low! You guys are really good at the apology game! What will change? When will u guys learn?
2,"@united My post was just more of disappointment.  I'm a frequent United flyer, it was a simple ??.  1 bad apple doesn't spoil the bunch."
4,@united you guys continue to impress me in Houston. http://t.co/cIh1qNllcM
0,@United I have no way of making phones calls... Need to handle via Twitter/email/web. Thank you!
2,@united Please help... I am in Ethiopia adopting a two year old child. Have an existing confirmation #. Need to add child to reservation.
2,"@united question:are there onboad 110 volt outlets in all planes? If so, where?"
0,@united Your website deserves a new design. #html5 FTW!
0,@united thanks for effing up our holidays - we're missing a full day of skiing due to your baggage team's incompetence at @FlyYOW
2,@united Twitter isn't letting me DM you..
2,@united I hope so too
0,@united agent helps the person in front of me.  Finishes up with them and then walks away.  The guy behind me is as shocked as I am.
0,@united Connection at ORD was on the exact same plane again. Checked carry-on was apparently taken off &amp; left in Chicago. Pretty ridiculous.
0,@united Not encouraged that I'll have my CPAP tonight.
0,@united Yes. Did file a claim as soon as the carousel stopped without my bag on it. Got an email that its found but not sched for delivery
2,@United an idea: monitor mileage members travel patterns enough to know when they change jobs/lose status...and make the transition easier.
0,@united  Delay DEN-CLE because they have to manually enter baggage tags? Really? Worst cust service day for this 1ker. #friendlyskies??
0,"@united Why tell us flight is delayed, then tell us it's on time again with 20 min to spare? Don't say it's delayed unless you're sure!"
0,"@united yes in Lusaka, Zambia. My guess is the bags never made the plane at IAD."
2,@united where is my flight voucher?
0,"@united Late Flight to Denver, Late Flight to Newark...let's not even get into the disaster that was checking bags. Unacceptable."
0,@united has once again let me down. Don't think I've ever flown with them and not had problems. Worst airline period.
0,@united yes I filed a claim &amp; hope to receive by luggage by 2am. Ridiculous as I had to purchase items to go to sleep &amp; no reimbursement.
0,@united UA938 ORD-LHR.  bags are being loaded 30min Late Flight. Frigid air into cabin! Plane feels like falling apart! Upgrade long haul fleet!
0,"@united Flight attendant never served me my beverage (tea), and not once checked up on me. What gives? #ua6076 #notcool"
0,@united load balancing system apparently down #systemwide - major impact on all #united airlines flights. Was this a #cyberattack?
0,@united After our unscheduled refueling stop and missing 2 connecting flights we r home n looking 4ward to our bed and a big PB&amp;J sandwich.
0,@united @AmericanAir spent hundreds to rectify the situation and you guys go quiet
0,@united UA276 sitting at EWR nearly an hour after sked.  Pilot says computers down but no clue when we will leave.  Can you help?
0,@united @AmericanAir so that's it? It just ends there? Come on! I traveled for literally an extra day and a half because of this!
4,@united Made the upgrade list. Will fly 1st tomorrow (for 40 min) for the first time ever! ðŸ™Œ #StatusMatchPaidOff http://t.co/ATfRKp6goY
4,"@united not just refunded, but for those of us who are on vacation to get a free room night to make up for making us sleep in DIA"
4,@united Thanks for the reminder. It's been a fun ride. http://t.co/pPVA4Rch9f
0,@united I received my luggage that also looked to be left in the snow when I arrived. I'm asking for all 50 people to be refunded.
0,@united updated A320 aircraft has wifi and device entertainment but no outlets. I don't get it. How can I charge devices?
0,@united was no one between the scan and inside the plane. I just asked the people in line around me where the plane was going
0,"@united 5 gate changes, two delays.  Even the crew thinks the airline sucks"
0,@united I'm very frustrated and have wasted 2 days now due to your equipment failures.
0,@united computers are down but you stopped giving updates and took my flight info off the app. That's just ridiculous keep people updated!
0,"@united Soooo, it's been 15 days and you've offered no response. So I assume poor treatment by gate agents is the norm now?"
4,@united Terrific. Many thanks. Looking forward to being back on UA tomorrow. Had a great flight up to Vancouver.
0,@united Calls to 800# resulted in 2hrs of hold time &amp; 2day wait to check suspect code share fare. Nothing investigatedâ€”my time wasted (2/2)
0,"@united It's taken ~3 weeks for Cust Care to respond to Case #8477733, requesting a refund for wi-fi not working. Where can I get an update?"
4,@united I appreciate your efforts getting me home!
0,@united That's correctâ€”I've spent hours trying to book online only to receive an error when clicking final purchase button. (1/2)
0,@united Today was not your finest. All could have been prevented by one gate agent advising 200 passengers.
0,@united  what is the real deal with the delay on flight UA 1032 from Denver to Vegas?
0,@united UA63 from Madrid arrived no agent mass confusion we sent to and fro by 3 UA employees. MaryJo was rude and unhelpful.
0,@united system failure again = bad trend.  Software projects are like flying an airplane; there's no such thing as an emergency takeoff.
0,@united lots of reports of system failures delaying flights over the last week. Currently sitting on the tarmac at OGG for over an hour.
2,"@united rebooting Chicago dispatch system, need @pivotalcf as I'm tired of sitting on planes"
4,"@united despite shaky connections, looks like I'll get home tonight. Great job, @united - was touch and go for a while.."
0,"@united http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn, however, is completely under your controlâ€”the price was and still is displayed on http://t.co/hj5kq82Chn."
2,@united the aircraft closest to gate was for the other flight and the one closest to our gate was going to Chicago.
0,@united can you tell me how to file a claim for clothing that had to be purchased?
0,@united comically on the return flight from ASE there were two United flights boarding at adjacent gates and not clear which plane to board
0,@united GRK13575M is the file reference
0,@united we would...how do I contact you to discuss? A few poor experiences with customer service but would give it a shot!
0,"@united UA 746. Pacific Rim and Date Night cut out. Not constantly or randomly, but one spot, repeatably."
0,@united Been trying since 1230 to file a report.
0,@united I send an email about my bad experience and you send back a generic response.  Yet another reason why I'll never fly with you again.
2,@united My mom left her Kindle on flight 1544 today. Burgundy case with a light. Seat 27D. Did anyone find it?
0,@united here is the ticket # 0162424965446 please refund my unnecessary upgrade fee

0,"@united flight arrives 30 minutes early, but then have we to wait for an hour for our bags."
0,@united That's not the issue. The fact that no one even called (despite promises) to confirm the bag's location is.
2,@united what's a girl gotta do to get a flight name change when SHE bought one for a mean ex boyfriend and needs a girl's trip stat?!
2,@united thank you. We are signed up for notifications. We shall watch and wait! â„ï¸â„ï¸

0,@united Exhausted &amp; frustrated! Link to a FB post abt my travel issue https://t.co/LaRKC8vc4s
0,@united I was denied getting on the plane w/o getting the chance to prove it fits. I'm not a rookie. Read my bio.
4,@united that's exactly the point. It fits. I'm premier access. Boarding group 2. This was a return ticket. I've been doing this for 15 yrs
0,@united I've never experienced worst customer service. Placing blame on codeshare partners and not assuming responsibility is unacceptable
0,@united currently on board so not now. Check in was terrible. Staff rude. Expensive luggage thrown around etc.
0,"@United fucked up, then voided my ticket, and KEPT MY MONEY.  Not even an apology. I will never fly with your airline again. #UnitedAirlines"
0,@united has the WORST customer svcs! This Kevin rep at call center must be investigated. My baggage's lost and there's no help but argument!

0,@united #albanyairport delayed departure to check bags at gate claiming space filled and walk on to open spaces a delay #poorcustomerservice
0,@united you Cancelled Flighted our flights for no reason &amp; now we have been on the phone for AN HOUR on our vacation. Why?
0,@united @dfpietra THAT'S your response?  Shaking my head back and forth with a tsk. You can do better-from customer service to your apology
2,"@united thanks! It's 35K miles from RTB to Europe, to do a multiple destination so we could stop over in US on way/way back- mileage diff?"
0,@united of course I did. The bag should be here by now :( #frustrated
0,@united you are the worst. I will avoid you like the plague.
0,@united is the worst airline in the world.
0,@united someone needs to DM me and resolve this correctly. Extremely disappointed with the service I received. Terrible management.
0,@united Premier Gold desk changes flight. Waives fees. Gives me wrong flight. Now Jana Acosta in Salt Lake refuses the same service. Angry.
0,"@united I will give you one thing, you are consistent but unfortunately you are consistent at not doing your job well #AlwaysDelayedOnUnited"
0,@united I will but right now I'm to angry
0,@united first time flying with United. Also last time. #terrible back to @VirginAtlantic for me. #branson #virginatlantic #UnitedAirlines
0,@united I used to be a committed #ContinentalAirlines flyer until merger. I remember now why I switched to @SouthwestAir #CommunicationFail
0,@united the least you could do is offer me a ticket in coach instead of just Cancelled Flighting my reservation because of your glitch!!! #notfair
0,"@united I'm saying I made the flight but with poor/non-communication, unaccounted for lost time &amp; lots of frustrated flyers standing around"
0,@united I think DM would be better
0,@United gate announcement states delay due to maintenance yet app says Late Flight arriving aircraft  tell the truth! @unfriendly
0,@united you are easily the worst company I have ever experienced. You have lost someone's personal possessions &amp; you couldn't care less!....
0,@united how can your app show arriving aircraft is early but departing flight is delayed due to Late Flight arriving aircraft? @unfriendly
0,@united already did that at the airport and 12 hrs Late Flightr its still not here! you guys are really killing me today. trying to stay positive..
0,@united once united's service levels reaches those of Etihad or lets be more realistically Lufthansa then ill consider it again
0,@united really?  Someone called in sick and then someone FORGOT to call a replacement?!  Now an hour Late Flight to take off. #theworst
0,@united Asked Flight attendant what typical compensation would be &amp; says we might get free TV. #Unacceptable
2,@united done
2,"@united Thank you, ^JH, appreciate the prompt responses--me and other passengers will be doing so."
0,@united has been such a disappointment today. Simply put. Rather unpleased with things currently. Flight delayed; cant wait to just get home
0,"@united During the same round trip, my NON-English speaking friend was stranded TWICE for 12+ hours each time! Most staff members were rude."
0,"@united  found a group of people who actually hates people more than ISIS, thats right United Airlines."
0,"@united Nope. Walked up &amp; down the ORF terminal, &amp; not a United agent to be found. Showed up @ last minute to board us. Many panicked people"
4,@united thank you
0,@united by the time I finally get to Dallas I could have driven with less frustration and cheaper.
0,"@united I'm trying to get to my final destination, we need compensation. Just about 2hrs of personal time wasted."
0,@united that guy really has no customer service clue.Could have spent effort clearing bins for rollerboards instead of art projects in mine!
4,@united he has no priority and Iove it
4,@united Pleased to be a Premier Platinum
0,@united how can you not put my bag on plane to Seattle. Flight 1212. Waiting  in line to talk to someone about my bag. Status should matter.
0,"@united @campilley hahaha. If they weren't an American company, i would say this was great sarcasm!!"
0,@united i think he actually did not like your screen  @campilley ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
0,@united Apparently they are asking 20 people to off board the plane--how can such a big miscalculation be made?!
0,@united It's a shame choosing #United may be the difference between reuniting with aging friends and never seeing them again #PoorService
2,"@united hi guys, do you have a general enquires email address please? Thanks David."
0,@united Just checking in again - what is the status of our claim.   It is going on 2 months with no attention to this?   We are very upset.
0,@united my flight was delayed due to maintenance in LIT and caused me to miss my connection at IAH to MSY. Can you help?
0,@united #UnitedAirlines Pls Fix #AspenBaggageFail issues. Had to pay my own way to #Aspen after flight Cancelled Flight. Left us in the cold in DEN.
0,@united Read my bio. See who I work with. I have NEVER encountered this with your airline before. Disappointed is an understatement.
0,@united Does customer care have email or a phone rep that I can speak with? We had so many issues they can't be placed in 2000 characters?
4,Thank you â€œ@united: @TRUU_Tall I can certainly take a look. Please follow and DM me your confirmation number for assistance. ^JHâ€
0,@united In the process of recovering their car rental - condo rental $ in Florida. They called #United for an alternate flight #NOANSWER
2,"@united I am buying 2 yo own seat on 3 legs of intl trip, car seat? Required? If not- then allowed? Can child still sit w/mom after takeoff?"
4,@united thanks for listening! I definitely was not the only person in line who thought it was absurd.
0,@United We've been waiting on tarmac for &gt;1hr because apparently UA1116 is overweight &amp; we returned to gate. #WTF #fb
0,"@united Thank you. Mention that before I boarded she asked 1other person to measure their bag, and it was another woman. Men not asked."
0,@united Can't leave the Tarmac ..united's gate agent cannot agree on a head count. 20 min now counting a 100 people max #epicfailunited
0,@united That's real dedication &amp; concern. Your apologies don't fix the issue nor any of the miserable issues I've had over the past 6 mos.
0,@United blocked me from DM'ing them because they would rather I complain about them in a public forum
4,@united ok. I just submitted. Thanks for the opportunity to give feedback.
4,@united Big thanks to Ms. Winston for assisting me over the phone with a baggage claim issue today. She really went the extra mile!
4,"@united I will, as soon as I am done with my article.  Thanks!  ~Tom"
0,@united booked flights for 2 for $779. Was charged $389.50 twice. Means I can't redeem CC points properly. Would have gone elsewhere.
0,@united We've had a ton of problems with getting our bags and have been given the run around for a day. Whats up with that?
0,@united pedophile airline. Split myself and my 10 yr old daughter rows apart on flight 1254 to boston
0,@united have been waiting 2 days for my military bags from an airport 3 hours away from me. Horrible.
0,"@united Arriving 25 minutes early is nice, but not if equipment isn't ready. Waiting 30 minutes for luggage, so far. Time gains wiped out."
0,@united is doing musicians real dirty at LAX. I've never been blocked from getting on a flight with my bass.
0,"@united I'm rebooked now, but the line was 300 people deep."
2,.@united For those playing along at home: http://t.co/2b4bDTldX2
0,"@united @FlyEIA yes, they said it took more than an hour!"
0,@united those whose pay to actually fly with you over 30k/ year deserve better service than a CC holder.
4,@united Ok thank again for your help!
0,@united Not a happy flyer.  UA flight 1161 from SFO to Cleveland.  Sunday 2/22.  Stay tuned for blog article from http://t.co/VdFdODqVGx
2,Thanks @united. @imran_r44 had a question about the wait time for baggage on UA6366
4,@united flight 1491...plane from SFO to DEN is basically on time.
4,@united thanks. Just a program comment; the system assigned seats behind each other even though pairs were available. I changed it back.
0,@united 20 min more delays to flt 2086 at sfo 2 load 2 more pax makes no sense. Will strand many of us overnight at ORD due to missed cnxns
0,"@united Heads up We didn't check 8 bags, 2 we checked arrived, those aren't claim #s for our 2. Other people's bags? http://t.co/dplQ3mhQGD"
0,"@united This must be a drone â€œ@united: @KeamBleam We understand your frustration. Our Bag team is working hard to get your bag(s) to you..."""
0,"@united Change made in just over 3 hours. For something that should have taken seconds online, I am not thrilled. Loved the agent, though."
0,@united flight attendant doesnâ€™t understand not understanding English doesnâ€™t mean they are deaf. Stop yelling English slowly to them.
0,"@united Not appropriate to ask in public (hence the dm). each united employee, each a new answer. your process was such a hassle i Cancelled Flighted."
0,@united well that's big of you but I don't have terribly high expectations at this point.
0,@united it's like you're trying to make me hate your airline. Fee for each checked bag that's never mentioned in the ticket + rude agents ðŸ‘¿
0,"@united nice your app says US 4972 delayed by weather.  Pilot says waiting on fuel.  One in ur control, one not"
4,@united Please than Robin at EWR Premiere Desk for helping me get on a an earlier flight. She did the work.  Huge thanks.
0,"@united Ok thank you, do you provide complimentary hotel accommodations since I'll have to stay overnight?"
0,@united I was originally trying to share details but the link Jimmy Samartzis Vice President - Customer Experience sent me expired.
0,"@united really? 3 hr delay, 4 gate changes, &amp; you boarded us, sent us back up, &amp; boarded us again.  Won't change our flight. Can we go now?"
4,"@united that would help! or how about integrate it into the App so I can just ""activate"" it and surf..."
0,@united I did. The AC went on for about 20 minutes before returning to the Mojave Desert. #PressureCooker #HeatTrap
0,@united Nope - still no one helped me.  Giving up on united. #badservice
2,"@united 8602947, jon at http://t.co/58tuTgli0D, thanks."
0,@united when an airline causes the missed connection u would think they would take whatever steps to remedy that screw up.
0,@united I'd thank you - but you didn't help.  taking 6 hours to reply (so I get a message in the middle of the night) isn't actually helpful
0,@united Flight UA1270 is descending into farce and we haven't left EWR yet. Is this going to get any worse?
0,"@united I was told it was due to be on UA23 which flies direct to Dublin, so why did it go to London? This is a complete shambles!"
0,@united 45+ min at EWR baggage claim #stillnobags #ridiculous
2,Flight Booking Problems for a travel writers trip I am hosting and need to be happy when I land! Do you have the cute PJs AA does? @united
2,But I don't see AA @united
2,@united Did you find out where it is? Thanks
0,"@united On a standby to Denver, which has been delayed, and a confirmed to Aspen, whose flights have been Cancelled Flighted all day. 0 confidence."
0,@united yes at 2am...but now back on a plane again and delayed again due to baggage loading issue... http://t.co/NfAQHhr09j
0,@united at what pt do u just Cancelled Flight!  Finally got stndby 4 1pm flight. What a day!  #missedWork #clientNotHappy http://t.co/sUPrLfOi8T
4,@united thank YOU for your kindness. Your agents went above &amp; beyond to get my stranded family home.
0,@united don't see a justifiable cost to get on an early flight with seats. No airline charges to conveniently get their passengers in early
0,@united Woke up to notification- flight moved 1.5 hrs early. Barely made flight then 3 hrs layover in SFO - wanted to hop on earlier option
0,"@united I will do delayed baggage claim when I land. Hopefully the bag isn't broken into, damaged or lost w/c will result in more complaints"
0,"@united done. Want me to send a screen shot of the second call, which is now at over 45 minutes?"
4,@united look at this beauty ðŸ˜‰ dc 10 united airlines ðŸ˜‰ http://t.co/MvYoizRPdE
0,@united Thanks! I'll fill up the form as soon as I land. I don't like being duped so I hope you will appreciate my feedback &amp; will be better
0,"@united, this is the line in Denver to rebook due to weather issues. DO BETTER. http://t.co/tmccExYaaQ"
0,"@United the ones who suffer. I understand delays, I don't understand trying speed up a process that has been delays to this extent."
0,"@united 2 Cancelled Flighted flights Late Flightr, agent claimed she put me on a new flight but then Cancelled Flighted it. Coworker got on flight- now delayed. Now?"
0,"@United of urgency, but this is ridiculous. Your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
0,@united I wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit
0,"@United flight was scheduled for 11:56, it's 1:05 and we haven't moved. I have never been on a flight where everyone moved without a sense"
4,@united ok thx!
2,@united I can't DM you so here's the confirmation # G8CVWJ - please is there any way I can make it to Kailua tonight? Thank you
0,@united go to hell
0,"@united since bulkhead seats cannot have bags on floor, why don't u reserve o/head space above those seats? In 1B on UA246 - not impressed"
2,@united Definitely will!
0,@united Would be helpful if you could refresh boarding time info on boarding passes for delayed flights
0,"@united  18 flights so far this year. 13 delays including 2 Cancelled Flightations.  Late Flightst reason, crew needed mandatory sleep. IN MEXICO!"
4,@united great to hear Thankyou so much. Greatly appreciate your replies. Feel much more settled now.
4,@united counter agents at RDU deserve a medal. #thankyou
0,The saga of the @MelissaAFrancis bag delay w/ @United - will there be a reunion or will she be forced to go shopping? Stay tuned.
0,@united Flight 211/ORD gate agent tried to prevent me from taking onboard a bag I've used for 15 years! Flight crew was more reasonable!
4,@united thank you. Literally called for preboarding as I ran up.
0,@united why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? Making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
0,"@united it was UA381 on 14 Feb. Point is, overselling flights= bad. Making people wait 1hr while you kick them off after boarding is worse"
4,@united that's brilliant Thankyou so much. Is it classed as part of carryon?
2,@united what gate is ua5396 leaving from?
4,@united thank you for listening to my compliant and doing the right thing. I appreciate you working with me
0,@united we've been here since 3am and you've Cancelled Flightled our flight twice
0,@united no chance I wait in ORD all afternoon for another flight after you screwed me. Hold 5396
0,@united UA5396 can wait for me. I'm on the ground trying to get to the gate after we were moved to B. This is crap.
0,@united from MEX NRT (dates TBD) but I'm getting a 200 to 300 USD difference in my quotations through September when compared to MEX BKK
2,@united fails again. @SouthwestAir saves the day.
0,@united better just keep connection from ORD To FWA that boards in ten minutes open until I get off the plane that just landed an hour Late Flight
0,@united is there a United gold number? I've been on hold 24 minutes and think I may be lost in nowhereland. Have a gold reservation. Help.

2,@united. It's not my first time flying to the US. I have medical info. Looking for practical like my adapted seat cushion allowed on?
0,@united noooooooooooooooooooooope.
0,"@united Oh, we are sure it's not planned, but it occurs absolutely consistently, it's usually the only YYJ flight that's Cancelled Flightled daily."
4,@united @JMS2802 : outsource it all United Airlines...your customers  are just loving you for it. Outsource. Outsource. Outsource.
2,"@united Hi, Im flying SFO-LAX-SAL-CLO. My connecting time in LAX is 1h45m. Is it enough time? Do I have to collect my bag and recheck on AV?"
4,@united Thank you! You need to follow back tho otherwise I can't DM you. X
0,"@united it's not getting any better. I'd suggest you get a senior manager to this gate , then retrain these gate people"
2,"@United States faundation was by faith Judeo Cristian,@Not it was by ideologias.@ http://t.co/mWBk68k0A3"
0,@united @JMS2802 : nothing like supporting your own mechanics and maintenance workers...instead United puts out a video of TIMCO doing wifi.
4,@united Just sent! Thanks :)
0,@united already missed  connection ugh
0,"@united @JMS2802 : sure show a video of your outsourced favorite TIMCO, who has a knack for doing substandard maintenance work on aircraft."
0,@united How do I formally complain about your customer service handler who misconnected me. I was denied boarding &amp; I now lost my bag. Help!
0,@united there are a lot of unhappy cold people on the bridge in freezing temps for an hour. Not given any info.
0,@united flight 3763 IAd-Sat. We're on the outdoor track for an hour
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline w/out WiFi...and pls no 'unwind' BS.
0,@united u would not be able to rebook me to get home any sooner than a now 2hr delayed flight.  #linesforever #customerservice #fail #again
0,@united you're the reason this whole travel experience has been a nightmare
0,@united what a pointless tweet. At least @AmericanAir asked me to follow them to try and resolve
0,@united that's not even an apology
0,@united that's cool - now what?
0,@united - SERIOUSLY it's 2015?!?!  NO WiFi on a 5hr flight from CLE-SFO #1589.  You're the ONLY airline without WiFi...
0,"@united, b4 boarding this attendant took his shoe &amp;sock off at the desk and showed other agents his foot. So gross. http://t.co/755VpYm4Mv"
2,@United are you able to see if there are seats open on another flight??
0,@united #unitedairlines so is it 6:20 pm or 12:20?   ORD ABQ 3709.   I can't even take a walk without missing a change.
0,"@united Hopefully my baggage fees will be waived tomorrow when I actually get on a flight, as well as compensation for my hotel room"
0,"@united Either is fine. However, plundering my hard-earned dollars is not fine."
2,@united @retailbagholder hahaha. At least they gave u a refund.
0,"@united your SFO-YYJ fight is Cancelled Flightled several times each week, why even bother?"
0,"@united, and now while waiting for new pilot the door on plane BROKE. why am I global services status  on an airline that's unsafe? STUNNING"

0,"@united
You really know how to piss people off. Your Farelock option is fake!"
0,"@united, last week shanghai to sfo 858 delay 5hrs bc of engine. today sfo-sea delay to ""sick pilot"". no compensation. They Do. Not. Care."
0,@united only thing confusing me is why I lost priority boarding? I'm a mileage plus card member ðŸ˜”
0,@united We're hoping to hear from you actually.
0,"@united shes been rescheduled for today, but with the frigid cold, being a possible reason for ""maintenance"" it could be the same issue 2day"
0,"@united It's the fact that an international should not be with out her bag and no sense of what's going on other than ""maintenance""."
0,"@united b) I contacted you directly, and the phone service was Laissez Faire at best.  The problem isn't a Cancelled Flightled a flight."
0,"@united a) she's an international. Her phone is on the fritz, I had to get to Chicago from nearly 4 hrs away to figure everything out."
0,"@united sorry for the delayed response. It was UA #381 Chicago to San Fran. Held up for almost an hour on the Tarmac. Also, lost my bags"
0,@united Okay thanks if you could please update me. I was told at the airport someone would call me today but they haven't.

0,"@united Cancelled Flights flt from EWR. ""No crew"".Tells wife &amp; 4 yr old to ""get to NY to catch @AirCanada"" to YYZ! Good #customerservice is dead."
0,"@united Now arriving a day and a half Late Flightr than supposed to. Lesson of the day, don't believe verbal or written confirmations from United"

4,@united thank you!
4,@united Thanks for the update.
0,@united and those three people were awesome working very long hours. It is easy to say sorry on Twitter but you should help your ppl @EWR
0,@united I guess. But what is the excuse for understaffed costumer services? 3 people had to deal with lots of angry passengers. Weather too?
0,"@united ,now you have Cancelled Flightled my wife and daughter's flt?? What's going on? Follow me so I can dm details."
0,@united Has it departed? I was awaiting an inbound plane yesterday for three hours and it never arrived. Had to stay overnight (again).

0,@united looks like today will be my 6th consecutive delayed flight from you...do I win a prize??? @Southwest Air why don't you fly to SBA? ðŸ˜­
0,@united sitting in a plane with no pilot.  Thanks! #waitingonapilot #denver #siouxfalls #whyairtravelsucks
4,@united Understood and thanks! I should have tried reaching out sooner.
0,@united already done that. the answer i got was... oops we can give you miles and we're very sorry. but who pays for my discomfort for 9 h?
0,@united received hotel but no food.  Also email for 3750 miles.  Last trip had 3 hr delay and 5000 miles - so less for Cancelled Flightlation?
0,@united Do we know why UA5282 is delayed x2)? This is getting crazy. I've already had 2 overnight delays. #UnitedAirlines
2,@united follow back and I'll give you the details.
0,"@united and most frustratingly, all this delay happened either at the gate, or even onboard the aircraft! No heads up in advance!!!"
4,@united The DEN b44 agent (9:30am) was amazing. The MPAgent at check in? She sucks. @seanMFmadden @PeterStraubMMA @jmercadoMMA @TonySimsMMA
0,"@united my UA3426 on 2/19 was also delayed by 2 hours, stretching my trip way past the midnight, extremely exhausting!"
0,@united Haâ€¦ you rebooked me in to an 11 hr layover &amp; are robbing me of a night with my family. Too Late Flight for that. Just fly on time for once.
0,@united switched to fly united from delta for the past two trips and was very disappointed. Now my UA4646 on 2/23 is delayed by 3 hours!!

0,@united  #UnitedAirlines  how long will1531 be delayed.
0,@united Why isn't the flight status updated to delayed UA1532 no board
0,@united I paid for economy plus and you put me in the last boarding group so I have to gate check my bags too? @VirginAmerica knows better..
0,@united i travelled from SCL- IHA feb 17. the AC on my sit (21L) was ON all night. I complaint to FA who never gave me a real answer. Help!

0,"@united JH, thanks so much for reaching out. I was able to get assistance after waiting for 70 minutes."
0,@united 3866 is at a stand still! No pilot or paperwork for fix over 25mins! Problem was fixed 30mins ago. Flight is as is delayed!
2,@united please see dm!!
0,@united. Is it reasonable to wait 45 mins for the bag you made me check because the flight staff couldn't police the overhead bins?
0,@united Please msg me a # for customer service. I will have an invoice for my dry cleaning but won't be able take wet clothes to the airport
0,@united AN HOUR DELAY BECAUSE YOU CAN'T PRINT A PIECE OF PAPER!
0,@united still no response??
2,@united 4 people MCI to DEL. Preferably with Jet Airways EWR-BRU-DEL segment. Anytime in December
0,@united should have been able to get seat assign without paying $174 more - cust sec should have done that for me
0,"@united There is no ""reference number."" Your agent told me to ""just drive to the airport"" because ""I can't reach anyone there to deliver..."""

0,@united Tried filling out the status match form and got hit with an error message. How can I tell if it went through? http://t.co/JbDkxd6eFz
0,@united Is flight 746 going to sit on the tarmac FOREVER?????????
0,@united One of your workers refused to give me her name as a reference for my notes. Her tone &amp; language was very unprofessional.
0,@united that's why I blame your company. Because it had every opportunity to do a job and managed to fail each time for just lazy reasons
4,@united I wanna be grand staff
0,"@united SF crew lack a lot of customer service, LAX employees are a lot better. Wonder why..."
0,@united that's why I missed my flight. If the flight had been held for 5 minutes I would have made it. I watched it pull away from the gate
0,@united also didn't ice the frozen metal walkway. Wasted 40 minutes because no one knew how to do simple jobs.
0,@united your ground crew was inept and left a truck sitting on the Tarmac. Didn't have a gate agent once we got a gate.
4,@united I wanna be ride United airline! I love airplane
0,"@united after 2 days - 1 flight Cancelled Flightled, another delay for 8 hours- united gave me a $7 food voucher. That's how much they value my time??"

0,"@united I am a loyal Premier Platinum member, but the lack of communication was really bad. Also, i donâ€™t see that it has taken off yet"
0,@united thanks for having changed me. Managed to arrive with only 8 hours of delay and exhausted
0,"@united This is the 2nd time I was rebooked (w/delays), and for reasons unreLate Flightd to weather. How do I go about requesting a flight voucher?"
0,"@united If you consider 50 mins for bags @ 10:00pm on a Sunday night ""as fast as they can"", you should reconsider what you think that means."
0,"@united It's the horrible attitude from staff after , not just the delay. Not the level of service or respect one expects from United"
0,@united why do you want me to be loyal  if don't let me carry on my bag that easily fits in overhead
2,"@united UA flight 1247. SFO to LAX took my carry on at gate. I'm Group 2, overhead bins are empty"
0,@united On top of that I paid for 1st class and my wife got stuck in coach.
0,@united Ph the pat answers are BS. After I was denied boarding it sat at the gate until 9:05! Your employees totally suck.
0,"@United Over the last week, United has provided me with the worst customer service experience of my life. Disgusting. #united"
0,@united 24 hrs since flight landed and ZERO info on my missing bag? rough ETA would be hugely helpful + restore some confidence
0,@united big surprise #nogate waiting for our plane. Same fucken issues everything I fly you. #fail #worstairlineever
0,"@united Not to belabor my point,but shouldn't I be able to put a laptop bag above my seat?  Why is it announced to leave it for rollers? Thx"
0,@united maybemange the airline alittlebetter. Arrived at LAX and no GATE! #howisthatpossible always the same thing w/u
0,@united I just checked my united app and the most valuable use of this app has been removed. I can no longer see the status of my equipment?
0,"@united even after running to gate from your connecting flight, your customer service not let us in the plane that was just parked. Stranded"
0,@united I'm desperately trying to understand how my girlfriend is being treated with this Cancelled Flightled/delayed flight.  #unacceptable #ORD
0,"@united Nope, no more chances. Your airline messed up both ways of our trip."
0,@united Why announce it is for rollers at all? If I want to put a coat in there isn't that my choice?  How about all gate checked? Thx
4,@united you're my early frontrunner for best airline! #oscars2016
0,"@united  bags left behind because plane overweight, be great if knew as soon as we landed, instead letting us wait 45 minutes with no info."
0,@united You are a F&amp;$KING joke. Your customer service is woeful. If your staff tell a passenger that they will do something do it!
0,@united was a sponsor of the oscars? No wonder it was a half hour delayed. #Oscars
4,@united Worked like a charm. Bag was waiting on the carousel when we got to baggage claim. #welldone #goodflight #friendlysky
0,@united will lose my bag but won't give me free pretzels #frauds
0,"@united you are trying to charge me 150 bucks because you lowered your award tickets and I want to get my hard earn points back, total BS"
0,@united does asap mean two hours worth of delay and a return to the terminal to count the luggage a third time? #gottogetbetter
0,@united Apart from being on hold for over 2 hours and having talked to 5 people and the problem still not resolved!
0,"@united typical caned response from UA, fix your crappy performing, last placed/ranked airline in this century!"
0,@united is it even legal for you guys to advertise flights that you cant honor??
0,@united customer service is the WORST. hanging up on customers intentionally after one hour on hold.
0,@united was forced  to book a flight on a different date than originally planned for a higher price $1130 felt like a bait and switch tactic
0,"@united love how you don't give a shit about people who tried to be loyal, but you screw them every way till Sunday. Glad I've stayed away"
0,"@united tried a different flight IAH-MNL 4/1/15-4/17/15, 6 flights are advertised for $1038 but are not bookable (due to partner error)."
0,@united it will be on a different airline.
0,@united and was told that its been the case for weeks but is still not resolved.
0,"@united clicked ""upgrade now"" and it didn't upgrade. What gives? http://t.co/N7oSjz8a59"
0,@united you advertise the flight and its still on you website and still can't be book. spent over 2 hours with united support
0,@united tried to book a flight IAH-MNL departing 3/31/15 returning 4/17/15 you are advertising 9 flights for $1051 that can't be book!
2,@united I just booked a flight for (2). When I view my reservation it has MI connected to First name. Is this a problem? can it be changed?
0,@united quick (serious) question - any resources/ratings showing the quality of service is better than 8th place? http://t.co/deWIthPeW2
2,@united How do I get through @TSA to finally board UA 1534?
0,"@united yes I have and I was calling in regards to speaking to someone about it even further, but unfortunately i was just bounced around."

0,@united i need help but in spanish
0,"@united A very disappointing experience - plane mech. delay and next one didn't wait. No sincere apology, just told me to complain online"

2,@united @reccewife with the exception of everything you've asked for. Heh

0,@united either your staff or whoever you contract with at PVD is failing you big time tonight...
2,@united UA1469. Just landed.

2,@united flight 435
0,"@united worst flights I've ever had. ground crew ignored our plane, made me miss flight and now I have to cover the cost of a hotel. #DEN"
0,@united customers aren't dumb. These revenue based programs will hurt everyone. Not gonna save money like you think
0,@united it was me who had the problem won flight ua 1580. I called and rebooked myself found my own hotel and taxi
4,@united will do. Thanks for the help. Cheers
0,"@united bull crap.  I spent $600 on a recent trip.  That's not small change. I got 10,000 AA miles.  Would have only been 6600 UA"
0,@united yes I did. Terrible service from your courrier

0,@united your worker told us not to call because we'd be talking to someone in Thailand...
0,@united - Going on 3 days (tomorrow) and I still haven't received my bag from my flight to Toronto. Would love to see some seriousness here.
0,@united is there nothing you can do for me? No compensation at all? Given the circumstances I feel like there must be something you can do
0,@united there is a disconnect between your PR group and the actual business strategy and employee attitude on the ground.  #liars #united
0,@united here we go again. 2 of 3 segments SFO--New York RT were delayed OVER 2 hrs each! Why do you suck so BAD!?!Maybe another line of bus?
0,@united you really screwed up dealing mechanical failure from Maui to San Francisco. Poor communication bad help in getting connections
0,"@united if you don't like delayed bags, why do you let it happen so much?"
0,@united the delay is due to customer service for 20 people?  What about the DIS-SERVICE you provided for 100+?  #FlightFail #Hour20Delay
4,@united he is so excellent and so reliable :) #happycustomer
0,@united but again UNITED DOESNT GIVE 2 SHITS ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS
0,@united its funny how none of ur tweets back are helpful what I want is to read 'ya we'll change that so our customers get better service'

2,@united Why have airlines always told us they can't open a cabin door once it has been closed?  This plane has done it 3 times tonight.
4,â€œ@united: Looking for a reason to travel? #quote http://t.co/GGuIg3t28zâ€
0,@united I can't find any Late Flight evening flights. Are there other airports that would have an overnight flight?
0,@united Thanks for the vague canned response that doesn't address the issue!
4,@united thank you!
0,@united that's not good enough for all of us affected by the awful organization and timing and have now been set back
0,@united  Otis in the baggage claim by Bay #8. not at all happy but not nearly as pissed.
0,@united Why is my time less important to you?  #StrandUsInDenver #HourAndTenMinuteDelay #FlightFail
0,@united airlines: you kidding? Bagage lost this morning from ny to Washington and still no trace? #badservice
0,@united I did. It took about an hour and a half though
0,@united Why have you never held a plane for me? #HourDelay #MultipleDoorOpeningAndClosing #DangerOfGettingSnowedIn
0,@united i did but i got nothing from it. Just dissapointment =(
0,@united WHERE IS MY FUCKING BAG?!?! Where the fuck is my fucking bag??? TELL ME NOW OR GIVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL A HUMAN. SAN68059M
4,@united I was sincerely thanking the pilot of flight 4461 of braving the snow and getting me home amongst many other Cancelled Flightlations.
0,@united Made@it to the gate at 8:23 and they wouldn't let us on. http://t.co/xAToxBnsFa
0,@united time to give up my 1K status and switch to @Delta - you are so terrible I can't even describe.
4,"@united Thanks! LOL! #UA6259 will wait for us. Per @flightaware, same tail number as #UA5525 :)"
0,@united You suck. Flight delayed equipment probs again. Miss connection by 2 minutes and you won't let us on even though it's at the gate.
0,@United #1758 now going in 40 min waiting for other plane to vacate gate. #findanothergate
0,@united Flight 2 is 2:30 hrs delayed so far b/c of Late Flight crew. Now we are literally waiting while they have dinner acc. to honest gate agent.
0,@United many people on Ua6318 are going to miss connections due to long wait time in SFO tarmac. Seriously u can't find an empty gate?
0,@united You're trying to solve problem of your own making. Charging for checked luggage forces checking at gate. Brilliant.
0,@united we've been waiting 45 min for a gate at SFO... Yet so many of them are free.  Your excellence in operational efficiency is showing
0,"@United ""delayed due to customer service"" Huh? http://t.co/XlTV5z6sT1"
0,@united what about the poor customer service at checkin at Kansas KCI?!? That's it???
0,@united except all of that delayed the flight anyway.
0,@United maybe find a different gate #ua1758
0,@united I sent a message. It's very irresponsible that my suitcase cannot be found. This is truly worst service ever... #fedup #disastrous
0,@United landed in den on time stuck waiting for gate for 30 min. Maybe an update would be a good idea capt?
0,@united wanted to point out that not one United crew has been sympathetic. Questions unanswered. MileagePlus is starting to look like a joke
0,@united can we get an explanation on why UA978 from SÃ£o Paulo to Houston has been delayed? Now we're hearing from crew about Cancelled Flightlations.
0,@united Why was flight 1180 EWR to MCO Cancelled Flightled for tomorrow and what do I do to rebook. Asking for a relative.
2,@united Can you tell me Jet Airways award availability?
0,"@united I understand the intent was not to inconvenience, but catching a cab back to the airport to show them wet clothes wasn't an option."
2,@united What are the chances of my flight to EWR from PIT being Cancelled Flighted tomorrow?
2,@united @baftz rcvd promo if i booked flight silver status would be extended it was not dont have flier that was sent didnt think id need
0,"@united, wife landed in DC 5hrs ago. luggage did not, was told it would B delivered/Hotel by 8pm. It's now 10pm, no luggage. #UA484"

0,@united not sure why the people in row 7 that paid for a premium seat can't use their overhead space... http://t.co/i9s86KiHge
0,@united is so cheap they couldn't afford to run the AC on #UA1510. They took pressure cooker to a new level. #Cheap #WorstAirline
0,@united why is it that Sundays when my husband travels to Chicago he's stuck at Tarmac &amp; misses connecting flight always
0,@united Well I can tell you that your customer service at RDU airport is horrific but is exception at O'Hare in Chicago.
0,@united sitting on UAL 683 - a comedy of errors.  UAL is incompetent
0,"@united on #UA3785 tonight and told delayed due to Late Flight crew. No idea where crew coming from, your staff ++unhelpful. Any ideas?"
0,"@united, take a look at status of 683, sitting at ORD ... This ain't cool, yo."
4,@united bummer but thank you for the quick response
0,@united I didn't have time to take my wet clothes/suit back to the airport and wasn't going to pay for another cab to do so.
0,@united didn't realize my bag/ contents were wet until I got to my hotel. Sent my suit/shirts out to be dry cleaned. Mtgs start tomorrow.
0,"@united You load our plane at ORD knowing pilots are 2 hrs Late Flight, then discover plane needs to be fueled? #WTF #united #incompetent"
0,@united resolved and im sick and tired of waiting on you. I want my refund and I'd like to speak to someone about it.
0,@united I'm really glad I just waited on the phone for over an hour to be sent to a voicemail. Your customer service sucks. Nothing has been
0,"@united, you just caused a riot on the airplane. Never seen anything like this"
0,"@united Instead of sending inaccurate emails about delay every 5 min, just say we will get you there when we get you there."
0,@united so glad I've been waiting for 1 hour and 15 minutes and Ive been transferred 3 times without resolving anything. Worst service ever.
0,@united we still need help. Hung up on twice. Customer service rep said there is no way to help between the gate rep and phone rep.
4,"@united They let us know in advance of the reboot, yes :) Thanks for the attentiveness!"
0,@united lol too little too Late Flight
0,@united yes. Bags came 1 hr after I arrived at baggage claim. Awful experience on the ground at BHM
0,@united @FernHeinig18 your delay is due to your own making. We have now been back to the gate multiple times. Maybe take accountability
0,@united Why do I have to give up my leg room so these 4 people (not in my row) can fill the bin?  Pls start charging. http://t.co/2nY5TuXFqf
0,@united please tell CLT flight 4232 needs a gate. Waiting now for 15 mins.
0,@united Why did you load us in this flying sardine can if you knew the pilots were 2 hours Late Flight?? #incompetent beyond belief
2,@united booked EWR-FLL in first for two on 3-8. Let's see how you compare to the garbage @AmericanAir first class has become
0,@united your seats are god awful.
0,@united good try but @SouthwestAir got her here safer and sooner
4,@United Wanted to compliment ur phone agent Jeanette for reFlight Booking Problems RDU to SEA thru SFO after connecting flight thru EWR was Cancelled Flightled.

2,"@united I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
0,@united I'm on UA1118 and my direct tv isn't working.  How do I avoid this in future?
0,@United is truly the drunk uncle of boarding. Don't believe gate agent that overhead is full; don't reserve aisle http://t.co/cdZhTyd0aK
0,@united i sure will
2,@united on the plane. I was thoughtful enough to ask for it and got it; there are prob others that also deserved it
0,"@united, any options to cos tonight? Doesn't look like #UA5525 will make it in time for #UA6259. Should I reserve a hotel room?"
0,"@united Appreciated, but in this case we waited an extra 55 minutes for a lost mechanic to fax the log. Fax...like in the 80s."
2,@united S/O to @Delta for coming in clutch and finally taking me home ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ
0,@united customer service sucks!  They hang up after waiting an hour and talking for 5 minutes.
0,@united JP - DM message who? Can't get a DM through to @united
0,@united strikes again! Why board anyone if there's something wrong with the plane? Common sense.
0,@united:  thanks for the miserable trip GNV&lt;&lt;&lt;FSD on 2.19-2.21.

0,@united this is it... Last time I fly #UnitedAirlines  you screw up every trip now will be stuck in ord and miss work.
2,@united Didn't know that buying a seat in first class was just a 'request' to sit in first class! Very Interesting.
0,"@united I understand the intention, but it pales in comparison to a day of lost wages for both my wife and I because of the delay."
0,@united I need help with a missing bag.
0,@united I was. But I have given up.
2,"@united can I get on a stand by list from ASE to ORD? I'm the only poor person in Aspen, that's why I'm asking for standby on twitter."

0,@united might possibly have the worst service on the planet.
0,@united deceptive marketing practices promised me if i booked flights i would retain my status now they are not granting. Neverflyunited
0,@united Hey so many time changes for UA 1534. We going tonight or what? MIA - EWR
0,@united and that it would be sent on the next flight to Hayden/steamboat (HDN) from Denver. So I'm hoping its on there
0,@united and pick it up and just bring it on the shuttle. When I went to double check on that they said it was still on the concourse
0,@united I honestly couldn't tell you. All I know is that originally we were going to have it brought in from the concourse
0,@united missing a day of vacation to see my husband because of this delay but stuff happens and I get that. Just wish it was handled better
0,@united UA1534 has now had 11 different departure times. Wtf. Make up your mind.

4,@united thank you for following up!
4,@United Claudia in IAH terminal b travel assistance has me all set. Great service. Thank you.

0,@united why do you hate your passengers?
0,@united how can a plane that has been sitting in a hanger all day have numerous mechanical problems. Doesn't anyone actually do maintenance
0,.@united in the future when delay causes 15 hour wait (slept night in airport) ensuring seating choice for replacement flight would be good.
0,@united is my flight delayed? It keeps changing between delayed and not??? If delayed is checkin time Late Flightr??? http://t.co/NTUIx5dbYR
0,@united what a long day of delays. Please get us to Dallas tonight!!!!  Fingers crossed!!!  #winterstorm2015 #whichisworsedenordfw.

0,@united I am appalled at your lack of communication during our awful journey on 2/21 EWR to BOS. 4 hr delays need to be explained better.
0,@united I'm DMing my info and no is assisting. My flight home left before m first flight had even landed
0,@united Boston is all self service. Swipe yr own boarding pass at gate. Most difficult: Tag your own bag. Not easy! #ImproveTheProcess
2,@united Name correct on original confirmation but spelled wrong on check-in reminder. First name and MI run together. Cause for concern?
0,@united more people would catch their flights if your attendants had more help!
0,"@United no consistency, #Denver agents say no standby with checked baggage citing FAA. Your website policy says otherwise. #time2switch"
0,Only 14 biz days (18 calendar) to respond to my inquiry @united ?  I hope your standards are universally adopted :-/ #BadCustomerService
0,@united Thanks but why did this occur? You guys had 3 hours extra to get my bag on due to your delay. So that's 7 hours you had. #fail!

2,"@United why not charge for 2nd carryon instead of checked bag? Less jockeying for overhead space, happier passengers, more ontime departures"
0,@united Adding reservation to iOS app doesn't show up on desktop site when logged in. And miles can't be redeemed for upgrades thru your app
0,@united I assume that would be for the other 300 people who have been let down by United? What's worse is plane is here but crew can't fly!!

0,@united they let us board again but will we fly this time? Who knows! #shouldhaveflowndelta
0,@united apparently sleeping in B terminal wasn't the worst situation. Someone told other UA passengers they had to sleep at baggage claim.
0,@united why don't you de-ice while the plane sits there with no one in it for 2 hours ?? Or we could just delay :/
0,@united fuck you for not caring ðŸ˜¢
0,"@united its been five days, I'm just asking you to clarify your policy on car seats. I don't want to have to take this higher up."

0,@united it is too Late Flight for reFlight Booking Problems now - it is morning already and I no longer need a hotel room
0,@united  once again your customer service at the providence airport was horrible. Do you actually care about customers or just making money?
2,"Sorry, @united. I accidentally popuLate Flightd with you instead of @USAirways. Can't wait 'til ""U"" are the only ""U"" in the sky. #NewAmericanStinks"
0,@united you have Cancelled Flightled my flight UA922 for aircrft maintenance. I'm delayed 10 hours now. What's my refund options?

4,@united thanks for the epic service on 863- always a pleasure- outstanding crew http://t.co/trqlpeinzW
0,"@united hey, it's 4am, guess what I'm doing? Not sleeping! Why? Cause you care so little about your customers you let them sleep in airports"
0,@united no my concerns were not addressed
0,@united DUH and done. bag whereabouts unknown. Greeeaat
0,"@united thanks for letting me sleep at DIA to ensure you ruin as much of my vacation as possible. Wait, no, fuck you. #unitedairlinessucks"
0,"@united oh, I'll be sharing alright. Especially about sleeping in this shitty airport and getting 1hr of sleep all night because UA."
0,@united @MaxAbrahms *if* he needs assistance? Do you expect him to go on a Scooby Doo tour of terminals until he finds his stuff?
0,Thanks @united for writing back. To assist you can return the bag you lost &amp; clean up the feces sprinkled in your bathroom. Too much to ask?
0,@united you hung up on me again.
0,"@united your ""customer service"" team in manilla is absolute shit. I can't even get a supervisor without being out back on hold?!"
0,@united it's disgusting and unconscionable the treatment I've received tonight.
0,@united of course I would like hepl! Are you kidding me? That's the ONLY reason I've been on hold for the past 5 hours!
0,@united @ThisIsCoach Every time my united flight got delayed. this is a big frustration.
0,@united you've got to be kidding me. I still haven't talked to a human and your robotweeting me?! And asking for a follow????
0,".@united I wouldn't describe feces sprinkled in your bathroom as an inconvenience. To help, you might find my baggage you lost &amp; return it."
0,@united and the fact that we were treated disrespectfully and lied to by members of your airline that claims to strive for the best
0,"@united is that all that matters, not the fact that we're at a different destination, we were put through a tremendous amount of stress,"
0,@united 1k member broken seat back broken tv broken light lost bag  gee thnx. UA922 awesome job
0,@united absolutely disgusting the way you treat your customers. Isn't there anyone actively monitoring your Cust serve? This is  unreal!!
0,@united nice. I wonder how you pick who to respond to? Maybe only happy customers are easier. I wonder how many of those you have left.
0,@united averaging 200 minute wait times tonight or what? I've gotten no help from you tonight.
0,@united thanks for nothing. Really?!? 60 minute wait times when I've had to call back 4x. That's 240minute wait times.
0,@united you're customer service is unbelievably bad. Abysmal. I've been on the phone for well over 2hrs tonight. Hung up on by yr ppl 3x.
0,@united you can read the full story when I submit a case to your team about the pilot of flight 6232 and why we are sleeping in DIA
2,@united what's with the layover in Canada from the UA125? Is that scheduled?
0,@united an inconvenience is a weather delay. Your pilot deciding to waste enough time so the FAA wouldn't let him fly is negligence.
0,@united I bought a ticket with a price that was published by mistake and now I got an email that indicates United Cancelled Flightled my ticket! Why?
0,@united new 737 plane; wifi: not working. Entertainment: non existent. New Seats: seriously uncomfortable. Really? #unitedfail UA1550
0,@united - you sure missed the mark on tonight's redeye from LAX to Chicago. What a mess! You can do better!

4,@united Life goal: complete âœ”ï¸
2,@united I have $20 and I'll draw you a super sweet picture of your choosing. Will that get me round-trip to San Diego? ðŸŒ´ðŸŒ´ It's so cold here.
0,@united flight Cancelled Flightled to Denver service agent offered me a non jet salt lake to Denver or red eye out of Atlanta then hung up on me.
0,"@united That's called throwing ""loyalty"" out the window and trying to give less awards."
0,"@united your unhelpful team? Sure I did. I'm in Bangkok, my bag in Chicago. Are u going to pay for my accommodation s until my bag arrives??"
0,"@united I'd hardly call going from 10,000 miles to 1,000+ miles a ticket cutting edge. About 1/10 the perk?"
0,@united that's not an apology. Say it.
4,@united Just sent a DM. Thank you for the acknowledgment.
2,@united download jeokoo the American app for air travelers
0,@united been on hold for almost two hours trying to talk to someone about a Cancelled Flighted flight tomorrow morning. What do you suggest?
0,@united no apology? Cool.
0,"@united you ask a lot of customers who  you routinely screw over. You know that, right?"
0,@united I'm a first time solo female traveller and it's pretty scary being in a foreign place not knowing where your belongings are...
0,"@united I am. Who knows where my bags are. Do I just wait around and hope they arrive? No one has answers, I have plans and no answers...."
0,@united somehow I knew that you'd wait until I was airborne to respond. #hacks #jokers #neveragain.
0,@united Missing flight attendant = Delayed Flight. Prime example how 1 person impacts 100's of people. HNL -&gt; IAH (UA252) #wastedtime
0,@united has me stranded in Texas and then hangs up on me when I'm trying to figure out how to get home. Cool.
0,@united we have tried to change our flight THREE times on the phone and got disconnected each time.
0,"@united poor showing today, no assistance to passengers who mis connected due to maintenance and waiting for baggage"
0,"@united has been showing the same tone deaf video for all these years about how ""wifi is coming!"" Hah.Not before I leave. @VirginAmerica ftw"
2,@united Can I get a follow? I fly with you for Christmas.
0,"@united more people stranded cause you suck. Better yet, you weasel out of Flight Booking Problems rooms for people claiming weather http://t.co/Flcnnn2USD"
0,@united look at all the delta flights that landed while your pilots claimed they couldn't fly 6232 to JAC. http://t.co/6Kp4m0R1f7
4,@united thank you! Much appreciation for your help.
0,"@united Been sitting on flight 435 for an hour after landing in Newark. First no gate, then no jetway operator. Seriously!?"
0,@united worst customer service experience ever. 40 minutes to get the jetway to the plane at EWR tonight. Flight 354   Disappointed
0,@united - not only 2 hour delay - double booked seat nit parked at wrong gate - incompetence at its finest - been waiting  for over 1 hr

2,@united I am following - you need to follow me for DM?
0,@united it would be great to get a callback from the agent that disconnected me trying to put me on hold after waiting to connectfor 60+min
0,"@united not a good day to fly u, two delayed flights still on plane at Ewr waiting over 1,5 hours for gate get to gate no gate agent."
2,@united just called and did it. Should have earlier because I'm being sent to DCA first and THEN to pvd. We may rent a car instead.
0,"@united my luggage is set to go to DCA however, I am rerouted to Dulles. Currently in NOLO however bags are in Houston. Can you fix this?"
2,@united I went from Sacramento to Minneapolis at the end of October 2014 in business class.

0,"@united when I read it say ' in some cases' can you please define this for me, when for example would it not be the case?"
0,@united I'm trying your WiFi on UA1616. But sorry it really slow. Even #Spotify lagging and that isn't a hard stream.

0,"@united flight UA1459 sitting at newark waiting for a gate, seriously??? #threehoursLate Flight"

0,"@united boarding was decent, 3 useless agents that don't speak English (after 2.5hrs of hold) 6hrs of mech delay not so much"
2,"@united After all I have been through on this trip, can you get me on another airline home?"
0,@united flight was Cancelled Flighted after the last opportunity to rebook us on other flights this evening passed.
0,@united boarding a #plane would be much faster if you boarded back to front instead of front to back #MakesSense #efficiency #travel #flying
0,"@united it's 9:56, and the desk attendant stated we would ""sit awhile"" until given the all clear. Lack of communication seems to the norm."
0,@united had been suffering immensely ever since this merge .. Hopefully I'll never have to fly @united ever again ..
0,@united I'd really like to get off of this plane now.
0,@united possibly the worst airlineGave them three chances Second time in 2 weeks a flight has been delayed and or Cancelled Flightled due to mechanics
0,@united cabin pressurization issues are pretty serious. Flight 1109 landed in Washington because of it. My head is pounding.
0,@united Sandra at ur international checkin counter was rude and offensive.  She commented she didn't care if I complained cuz she had 25yrs
0,@united My contact stuff is in the bag and I'm legally blind. This is so messed up.
0,@united Did I mention that I was ON THE PLANE so is my luggage. My luggage that I'm not going to have for how many days.
0,@united 3 times I've called customer services each at least 40 mins... Each time cut off by your operators... Why can't you call me back!
0,@united Tell me that you're at least going to cover a room and get me out of here.
0,@united OMG!!! you just bumped me off the last flight. Can this get any worse.
0,@united Which just speaks to basically the worst designed web system ever.
0,"@united Yeah, I tried that about 10 times for two different tickets, and it told me to ""Try again Late Flightr""."
0,@united please fire the captain of flight 6232 today. He single handedly ruined every passengers day by being a piece of shit. #unitedsucks

0,@united what exactly do you hang on this hook? http://t.co/ZHxOk07Aqa
0,"@United - flight Cancelled Flightled. 4 hrs at airport to book a new one for $95. Just got two invoices for the flight, each for approx $300. Really?!"
0,@united why do you hire POS pilots? Thanks for ruining my trip and not allowing me to see my buddy as he turns 30. #unitedsucksdick
0,.@united Your airline is again rated the WORST in America so you've got your work cut out for you. It's bc you treat customers like garbage.
2,@united what's the best way to get your tickets? Print off at home or go to check in desk?
0,@united Pay for my hotel.... I'm a broke student #help
0,@united all 4 of us are on standby in Houston tomorrow for flights to Calgary. If you could get us on one or two of those that would help

0,@united trying to get a customer service agent.  Just landed in SFO.  Can't fly with 3 layovers with 3 kids!!

0,@united how come a $27 shuttle bus from LGA to EWR has electrical power outlets but our new Airbus interiors do not? #whyjeff?

0,"@united It isnt simple issue, generally how you set up check in/baggage policies at Logan and general unhelpfulness of employees in early AM"
0,@United terrible illogical re-route after Cancelled Flightled connection. Then made me pay to check bag. Then lost bag. #ual

0,@united refreshes my browser right before checkout.error load message. Ticket price increased $358 in a matter of sec. DoUNotWantMyBusiness?
0,@united @JedediahBila Why is United voted every year as one of the worst airlines? Do enjoy that title? You should give Jedediah free passes
0,@united I think you should board from the back of the plane #whatstheholdup #CHItoCLE
4,@united On the plane but thanks! Maybe don't let so many people check in by themselves - teeming with morons.

0,"@united @bobwesson fair enough United. everybody is doing the best they can. Although that ""slight delay"" is turning into a Cancelled Flightlation."
0,@united Still waiting on our bag! Never got delivered yesterday. Can't reach a real person for help. Sending DM with ref number.
0,@united worst flight experience I've ever had. Will never ever fly your airline again.

0,@united why would a person take hours and hours of wait time just to tell a lie
0,@united hey! DM not working. UA 307!

0,@united splitting up my flights quadruples the price
0,@united contd... I am being told that I am asking for a refund on a used ticket on a flight that got Cancelled Flightled how is the ticket used?
0,@united after several trials and several hours of waiting on phone to contact customer care to get my refund all I get is cold shoulder
0,@united I booked and paid for a flight to get me to Denver at a specific time for a meeting. You failed... It wasn't caused by weather
4,@united since when did you get so good again!  4 transcontinental flights in 72h.  What a pleasure/relief you were.
0,@united what I don't understand isn't flight that I paid premium for getting Cancelled Flighted and the best you can do is next available flight...
0,"@united Flight is awful only one lavatory functioning, and people lining up, bumping, etc. because can't use 1st class bathroom. Ridiculous"

4,@united thanks for more timely updates.
2,@united Do you also want the naming rights to my first child so I can fly home and visit with my mother and avoid more winter depression?
0,@united I'm familiar with the procedure. It wouldn't be the first time #UnitedAirlines lost one of my bags. #unhappytraveler
0,@united I get that. But doing it by giving inaccurate/misleading info doesn't seem like a great way to do it. #hopethegearmakesitintact
0,@united cleaning a regional jet takes an hour?

4,@united I think this is the best first class I have ever gotten!!  Denver to LAX and it's wonderful!!!
4,@united of course not. The inflight crew was great!
4,"@united well played, ^LO."
4,@united The pilot of UA475 just landed this plane like he was gently placing us into a pile of whipped cream. Smoothest landing ever.

0,@united this is very disappointing. This is about customer service.
0,"@united boarded 6373 on time, deplaned, and now 100 minutes delay. No transparency during. Can't wait to give up my gold status for AA."

0,"@united Once again I am victim to the scam that is your SHIT Customer Service, this time the agent hung up on me WTF do you teach your staff"
0,@united flight 1219. My frustration boiled over after dealing with attendant. Her attitude was ridiculous.
0,@united nice to know that 3 hours of my time is worth $7.99. Free DirectTV for everyone! Ever hear of preventative maintenance?
0,@united that may be true however after 4 weeks matter is still unresolved and I can not get through to a supervisor or manager to help
0,@united obviously no one knows a darn thing around here.  What are we to do if this does not get resolved? http://t.co/Ph8QJzaPKx
2,"@united so going forward, I shouldn't be Flight Booking Problems Star Alliance flights through the United App?"
0,@united I have those notifications yet the staff on board say that is not accurate and they have no departure time.
0,@united I'm not know if the seats are actually narrower than other seats but they feel like it. Or maybe I'm extra bloated.

0,"@united will flight 5559 to YYC be providing free food when we are allowed back on board  after the ""broken lightbulb"""
0,@united I was not looking for the fare to be returned on the companion flight.  don't understand why an additional $200 fee was necessary.
4,"@united thank you so much, that helps a ton. Whoever is on this Twitter acct today deserves a handshake and a hot chocoLate Flight. #problemsolvers"
2,@united I left headphones in 2A on UA4689 from YHZ-EWR. It's a long shot to see them again. But worth a tweet anyway!
2,@united 129 thousand fans of @JedediahBila are asking you to give her your utmost effort to get her a safe flight with her baggage soon!
4,@united can't wait!!! 787!!! @tpallini http://t.co/oDlall5eDH

0,@united FLT 3444 delayed because of maintenance - that's fixed but can't board because flight crew didn't stay in boarding area #fail

0,@united usually your lounge staff are fantastic! Except today in MCO where almost denied entry to lounge even though traveling united-first
0,"@united 2.5 hour delay, misplaced bag, poor communication, and the worse: unsympathetic, confrontational gate agent. Not cool!!!"
0,@united Why don't you respond to my e-mails of facebook msg?! I'm still wating for my tickets!! I'm getting really angry and disappointed!
0,@united then send your Jeff Smisek on a trip with JetBlue or SW and make sure he takes notes. I would never choose to fly United again.
0,@united So disappointed in the service and the level of staff communication. Such a bummer.
2,@United pre-dawn flight to #miami from #EWR. Annual #SOBEWFF trip. Now.

0,"@united to top it all off, your flight attendants talked loudly throug the flight, even when the lights were dimmed. Resulting in no sleep"
0,"@united it seems like no one from United can help me. Lots of fingers pointed, zero people stepping up. At least the gate has Oreos"
0,@united they have access to the dial that makes it faster do they?
2,@united I'll be impressed if I actually get a response! ðŸ˜œ
2,@united hi I left my asus tablet on flight to Heathrow from Newark on 16th feb and wondered how long it takes for someone to check if found?
0,"@united 1hr delay at the start, huge queues at security, no representative to meet us, rude staff at baggage reclaim  #inefficient"
0,@united has the worst flight attendants. They are like those angry and drunk aunts that we all have. Everything has to be an argument.

4,@united I especially like how you upgraded three of your crew members to first class instead of passengers. #keepitclassy #customerservice
2,@united hello. I got off a flight a few months ago and constantly think about your peanuts. Is there anyway you could send me some?
0,@united Flt 359 lax to EWR. Your pilot bragged about getting to EWR early only to wait 20 min for a jetway driver. Thanks United!
0,@united I am so happy I found my phone because this is easily the worst system I have ever heard of
0,Really? 9+hours???? @united: @JenniferWalshPR We don't like delays and do all we can to avoid them. We'll have you on your way ASAP
0,@united @RobBogart After I waited hours in the airport being told one fib after the other. Why can't UAL be honest with its customers?

2,"@united I have a LH return business ticket from Den to Fra.If I fly domestic with you,bag can be checked through to Fra,no need to claim?"
2,"@united Also, a United phone representative just asked me for my web password. Is that normal?"

2,@united what is your plan to reduce delays?
2,@united I'm searching for flights to redeem with miles and getting different search results with 2 user accounts. Any reason why?
0,"@united rebooked 24 hours after original flight, to say your handling of situation was bad would be an understatement."
0,@united I would like a supervisor to talk to. Now we are waiting for a flight attendant as one just walked off &amp; left http://t.co/IpaamZT7Z2

0,"@united she was at the service desk at gate 21, and helped us find a flight to get us to our dest. on time when our flight got Cancelled Flightled"
0,"@united (1/2) thanks, but does not answer my question. I want to make a reservation over the phone in Perth, hold for 24hrs, and have family"
0,@united it wasn't a delay so much as a straight Cancelled Flightlation. Weather wasn't an issue either.
0,@united thanks for ruining my wedding anniversary. Flight UA4904 from EWR to RDU is delayed by over 3 hours and will reach home the nxt day
0,@united Cancelled Flightled my flight for some unknown reason and haven't really given me anything to make my overnight layover tolerable
0,@united the only difference being you are both responsible and in a position to do something about them. Learn from @Delta
0,@united Yes my flight was rebooked. I'm just losing trust in you if I want to get anywhere on time.
4,"@united thanks, keep up the good work"

0,@united broke my suitcase &amp; refuses to give me a repair estimate. http://t.co/zOUOwgv3Q6
0,@united How do you have a scheduled flight WITH NO CREW? Is there a competent person working at this airline?
0,@united can you help 689 in Chicago get to a gate. Freezing on a runway seems like a crappy thing to do at 9pm

0,@united ORD Gate C25 and Flt 619-  remember when customers were valuable? Is it so hard to be nice to someone lugging a guitar &amp; carryons ?
0,@united WORST SERVICE EVER. Denied access to our flight and then moved flight 6 times. How hard is it to schedule a gate? @Delta next time.
0,"@united I'm in Denver, my bag is in San Jose. See something wrong here."
0,@united you know it's bad when you're praying your connecting flight is delayed because of an hour delay on the first flight #JustGetMeHome
0,"@united playing hide and seek with the gate. ""We can't find it, it should only be a few more minutes."""
0,"@united so our flight into ORD was delayed because of Air Force One, but the last flight to SBN is at 8:20, 5 mins from now we just landed."
2,@united your flights are really cheap what's the catch
2,@united LGJW7B. I voluntarily rerouted; 1st leg of journey was in economy and was supposed to be 8B. Res agent said she'd reserve it for me

0,"@united What happened this afternoon? Huge amt of incoming planes to SFO delayed over 1-2 hours.
Frustrating!"
0,@united not about being on my way or impatience on my part...it's about you being untruthful and not having proper systems in place

4,"@united I'll stick with my United flight. Thanks, though. Effort is much appreciated."

0,@united I had to change airports to actually get a flight out when my flight from FAY was Cancelled Flightled twice. $180 taxi ride to RDU--reimburse?
2,@united it's operated by united as it's a heathrow-Newark flight
0,@united yes of course I have.  Is this how you treat customer with no recourse?
0,@united I will be stunned if my bags are in Hartford with me.  The ORD ground crew only had an hour to move my bags 200 yards
0,"@united Can someone assist me with my DM's? Waiting 1 hour on phone, 2 hours on Twitter."
0,"@united Flight was overbooked! Was offered voucher to wait &amp; take another flight. Gate agent switched me over, retracted voucher offer."

4,@united Thanks - it's very helpful to understand that the reduced price seats that are sold at check-in have priority over the certificates.
0,@united As a Million Miler I've been delayed plenty. NEVER in the amateurish way@SilverAirwsys does it. I'd be embarrassed to be affiliated.

0,@united now you've lost my bags too.  At least nobody has done anything to help out.  This is absurd.

0,@united offered me a voucher to switch flights. Now voucher offer doesnâ€™t exist &amp; the gate agent switched me to a delayed flight!
2,@united when southwest did this to us -- a mechanical problem at least they gave us round trip vouchers. Will you step up to the pLate Flight too?
0,@united I usually like flying with you guys but $200 fee to use my credit seems ridiculous #notcool #exhorbitantfees

0,@united do you guys have any working planes?
0,@united we just almost had a major accident on ua3710 ... How about passing on some information to those of us waiting on plane!!!
0,"@united again, you said to go take the time to go there, knowing what the issue was, and knowing you wonâ€™t fix it."
0,@united 3 hour delay plus a jetway that won't move. This biz traveler is never flying u again!
0,@united my son is a passenger on flight 3710 from Chicago to Toronto. The plane came within feet of colliding  another plane and is stopped.
4,"@united That made me so mad, but then I called the bag number, and that person was helpful and told me where the bag really was. (2/2)"
0,"@united Yes. It was the airport person who told me the bag was still in Nashville, when I filed the claim. (1/2)"
4,@united The only thing you fella have done right today is get me to the pacific time zone.
0,@united Ugh.  My bags were sent to Palm Springs and not to LAX as promised.  They better be at the hotel when I get there.
0,"@united Direct Messaged you, didn't hear anything back"
0,"@united yup, it just happens way too often...5 times in the last 12 months"
2,"@united Great, thank you!! I'll send it now."
0,@united so who does handle bag issues? And why wouldn't you put me onto them in the first place?
4,@united big up the pilot of 644 for turning 1hr on the tarmac to just a 20min delayed arrival
2,@united returned from vacation + went to luggage services. Golf bag was presented in clear wrap that could've been used in the first place.
0,@united Holiday of a lifetime to New York ruined because you lost my luggage and have failed to find it since Sunday! #wontflyagainwithyou
0,@united my golf bag didn't have a top cover + staffers said they couldn't check without a type of cover or wrap. Forced to leave the bag...

0,"@united My wife has been on the phone several times for past 3 days, with no result."
0,@united so you are saying that customer care does not report to anyone? Their response is humiliating for a company that serves the public.
0,"@united #unitedairlines so my feedback is for your benefit, not for you to correct your atrocious customer service? Good to know"
0,@united #UnitedAirlines fill out form and never receive response? I expect remedy. We can travel another airline and Cancelled Flight as members w u.
0,"@united 12/13EWR-LAX UA1151 my seat/armrest broken discover after takeoff. flight full.FA filed report, who to chat with for partial refund?"
0,"@united so you told me to go, knowing what the issue was, only for me to go there and find out that you wonâ€™t fix it?"
0,"@united so, I made it all the way to the airport, and they say they wonâ€™t fix the handle. I showed you this problem, and you said to goâ€¦?"
2,@united This link in your tweet goes to someone's internal email -&gt; http://t.co/ZksX79itdN...... Probably one of your 3rd party IT contracts
0,@united then why do you bother responding? Your customer service is THE WORST. Never using you guys again.
2,@united 618 was flight out of Houston
0,@united free hotel doesn't make up for such poor customer service and disregard
0,@united it's messed up to refuse to wait 10 min after united is at fault for delay but to leave early is absolutely disgusting.
0,@united mechanical delay occurred in Houston earlier today re: their flight to ORD

0,@united very disappointed in CC. Purchased ticket online w/ voucher and charge full amnt. Would not hold price after refund. Unacceptable
0,@united exactly it states a secure document is a nexus card. It does not state a passport must always be also presented. Read it
2,"@united We were told by United to ""carry over/carry back"" for the refund."
2,"@united no, I had to leave for work. Would have not been possible. So I would love to have this replaced now"
0,I feel completely cheated @united. I read your commitment to customer service via website and def did not get service suggested there.
0,"@united @annricord 0162431184663.
3 of your agents said we would be refunded. Agents said United should never have sold us the ticket."

0,@united IT-problems with the link? #3thparty
0,"@United: I feel very well informed. yes, the flight is indeed delayed. Thank you. http://t.co/FuCHZRZjg5"

0,@united can I get some help changing a ticket.  40 minutes on hold and counting....
4,@united thanks for all the help! Totally appreciate it and you made it super easy too
0,@united was told by Supervisor that United disconnected their customer support # so there was nobody to address it now. #igiveup
0,@united Your MileagePlus signup page is broken.
0,@united $7 for wifi just so I can tell my family I'm gonna be Late Flight cause i had to sit in a grounded plane for the past two hours...
0,@united FYI: continuous texts and emails I am getting about the delay while held captive on the tarmac are not that helpful.
0,"@united so, not only were you Late Flight, you broke my luggage handle. You paying for a new one? http://t.co/nYVV1X3d67"
0,@united: No friendly skies from you today. 5hr+ weather delay in SFO followed by 1hr+ mechanical delay while sitting on plane. #NoFun
0,@united once again your customer service rep was rude!   I asked a question and in turn got attitude.  Jane was no help.  Disgusted again!

0,@united obviously the staff at EWR - United or otherwise have not seen your ads about - being FRIENDLY and helpful #ewr worst airport

4,@united thanks! :)
0,"Hypocrisy RT @united @gg8929 I'm sorry, we're not able to offer a full refund because the exchange rate is not what you were hoping for. ^KP"
0,@united I shouldn't have to spend my own $$$ on a hotel because of a weather delay. The weather being something COMPLETELY OUT OF MY CONTROL
0,@united  eventually.  You should approach bags like @AlaskaAir  they get it.
0,@united What if my NYC flight is delayed and I miss my connection to Sacramento from Chicago?
0,@united said they would give us a refund. 30 days Late Flightr NO refund.
0,@united how can you not know the weight of our plane after us sitting on the plane for 2.5 hrs? Not convinced your company is safe for flt.
0,@united we showed up to our flight several hours early. Tried to call &amp; was on hold 15 min b/f call disconnected.
0,"@united if your policy changed, you must advise at the time of purchase.  Same if you choose to vary it by airport!  We want a FULL refund!!"
0,"@united wanted to, but you Cancelled Flightled my tickets.... They were too special i guess even for united."
0,@united I'm 0/3 for Flight Booking Problems without major problems. 0% isn't bad!ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž
0,@united @el_ingeniero don't check your baggage if you don't have to.  They will lose it!
0,@United I'm hoping we don't miss our LAX - ITO connection. Not looking forward to being stuck at LAX overnight with our team....AGAIN!
0,@united well perhaps you could highlight where that is stated.  We travel between Canada &amp; USA on United with only Nexus
0,"@united how can you not know, after two hours of us sitting on the plane with no bags off loaded, the planes weight?!"
0,@united You make it hard to fly with you. Delayed over an hour and now the plane  is turning around &amp; heading back to the gate. #connection?
0,@united  Serious firing needs to happen at HNL. They broke the wheelchair you loaned me after you broke mine! http://t.co/bT37KyrByJ
0,"@united Call customer service and of course they just say ""theres nothing we can do"" and then offer a transfer and disconnect the line."

2,"@united Does the economy plus cabin also qualifies as a ""premium"" cabin?"
0,@united flight UA3364 been sitting on tarmac for 30 mins with no report as to why...any input?

2,@united no thanks
2,"@united Yesterday, I'm sorted now."
0,"@united thanks for that advice, so helpful. Can't believe you guys actually charge people to ""fly"" united"
0,@united If you have had any issues with  United Airlines PLEASE retweet. Paid for a full fight ticket and was given a standby instead.
0,@united just tried to log in and was told e-mail log in not currently available
0,@united @gg8929 so why did you Cancelled Flight tickets for thousands of people when you didn't like the exchange rate? #doublestandards
2,@united do you have an e-mail address I can write my account to? Might be less likely to disappear
0,"@united so I wasted 40mins filling in 2 online forms you are telling me you didn't receive, how do I know this won't happen this time?"
2,"@united 877 from amsterdam to ewr, 02.27.2015, 737-300."
0,@united stuck here in IAH waiting on flight 253 to Honolulu for 7 hours due to maintenance issues. Could we have gotten a new plane!?!? Fail
0,@united @UnitedAppeals @gg8929 What kind of hypocrisy is that? Only Cancelled Flightling tickets with bad exchange rate if in your advantage #united
0,@united No. The entire problem here is that I was never sent anything via email and only given a Flight Booking Problems number over the phone.
0,@united calling that number was useless. Heading to the airport now to pick up my bags. this whole situation seems like a real joke.
0,@united They couldn't get me first class on any of their flights so I just rebooked myself.

0,@united waiting for flight 4567 to memphis. Incredibly rude gate agent waited until after departure time to announce delay. (1 of 2) #rude
0,@united I don't see how I need to spend an extra $100 bc of ur equipment failure.
0,@united I don't need to make any changes. I reserved my seats when I bought my tickets and there was an error &amp; now there are no comp seats
0,@united its 2015 and no power outlets at the seats on a 6 hour flight to California? Seriously? This is why airlines are failing!! Pathetic!

0,@united I somehow think I'm going to be stuck paying for a hotel room in Denver without winter clothes on my dime.  I guess we'll see.
2,"@united I normally ask people to put on headphones...but not toddlers. Maybe planes should have a ""kid"" section (near the back) ;)"
0,@united of course I need help.  I've been DMing you ladies and gents all day. Your only solution is hope for the best and LAX.

0,@united feck guys. Stop Cancelled Flightling flights from EWR to RIC the weather is fine I both locations!!!

4,"@united @FlyANA_official pleasantly surprised to find ANA has made major upgrades on their transpacific route in flights, planes and service"
0,@united Step 1: Cancelled Flight flight. Step 2: Don't notify customer. Step 3: Charge them for food while they try to survive their wait. Brilliant.
2,@united i need my confirmation number! Can you give it to me?
0,"@united + besides, no small degree of self-interest. We take that route several times a year &amp; would hate to be in that situation."

0,"@JetBlue the amount of money I spent on hotels for a WEEK bc of flight Cancelled Flightlation, another flight doesn't make up for the money lost."
0,@JetBlue being told JFK had a 5 hour delay this AM which is reason for my delay now. It can't be that hard to notify with 12 hours notice
0,@JetBlue by far the worst airline in terms of service at jfk.
0,"Keep Waiting, time does not cost anything for @JetBlue hundreds people how payed thousand dollars with no feedback http://t.co/Ji2pg4gom9"
4,@JetBlue you're still the best
4,"@JetBlue @ABCNetwork please give JetBlue all the permissions in the world! I'm missing the oscars right now, and it's awful #whyabcwhy"
0,@JetBlue Thanks. So the delay was the result of scheduling issues more than weather reLate Flightd problems?
2,"@JetBlue @shannonwoodward I'll be checking often. Most probably when they hand the oscars out to the nerds, geeks and badly dressed."
0,@JetBlue I am less concerned about the delay than I am about not being notified until I looked at the board that my flight was delayed
4,@JetBlue Thanks!  I made it ðŸ˜ƒ
0,"@JetBlue after boarding flight 0510, the captain informs that he could exceed the16 hrs regulation and turned the plane around. Incredible!"
4,@JetBlue thanks for the quick response! Fingers crossed the plane gets here then
0,"@JetBlue @julesdameron ""Considering?"" #Accessibility is an absolute MUST! #Equality"
0,@JetBlue how do we watch the oscars though right now?! No abc on flight :( #missingtheoscars
4,@JetBlue Thank you. Fingers crossed.
0,".@JetBlue ooookay @ABC that's silly of you. guess we're ""watching"" the oscars purely on Twitter reactions tonight. #oscars"
0,@JetBlue I've heard your new in flight tap to pay readers accept ONLY Apple Pay. I thought that was impossible &amp; certainly not EMV compliant
2,@JetBlue you're taking me to New Orleans in two weeks so I'll picture that while I shiver #forevercold
2,@JetBlue We're flight 1472 FFL to LGA. Scheduled departure 8:15p.
0,"@JetBlue 2nd time in a row a flight out of jfk a disaster. Last time I wasn't allowed to fly stndby, now a 2 hour delay w/out notification"
0,@JetBlue oh right! Me and hundred people arrived back to the same gate we left minutes ago in SDQ http://t.co/7gB0hgW51t
0,@JetBlue. A bunch of flights are delayed from FFL to Northeast destinations. No announcements at the gate. What's going on?
0,@jetblue I'm dissapointed in the way paseengers on flight 0510 in Santo Domingo have been treated. 9hrs to board the plane and no info given
2,@JetBlue id appreciate that. Would also you mind contacting the pilot of my flight and request that I be allowed to announce over intercom?
2,"@shannonwoodward If you want, we can keep you updated on who's wearing who, &amp; who's with who, &amp; who wins what. We're nice like that. ;)"
0,@JetBlue  I did.  They have no idea where it is.
0,@JetBlue thanks but still annoying. Especially if I miss my flight. ðŸ˜‰ Can I tweet at the TSA??
0,"@JetBlue hey JetBlue.  Still waiting to hear where you lost my 9'8"" surfboard between JFK and BQN airports."
0,@JetBlue your gif game is strong.
0,@JetBlue well but for now the only thng we can do is wait for someone to explain us the situation with responsibility http://t.co/ML1JaCpmch
0,@JetBlue flight 98 DEN to JFK already 2hrs delayed. Any idea how that might change again due to weather forecast etc?
0,@JetBlue Why close prechk at 8PM on a Sunday at JFK?  #annoying
0,@JetBlue your crew didn't say it was about safety. If they say that I was glad to stay ... Check the information you give to the costumers
0,@JetBlue you quite possibly ruined my entire first day in South Florida bc of your disorganization. #GetItTogether
0,@JetBlue I'm going to write a post on @Medium about the experience. Your customer service has tanked. #JetBlue
0,@JetBlue Still no response from CEO. I guess he is at the Oscars.  I bet his flight was on time.  #JUSTWRONG
0,"@JetBlue okay. Names of SJ crew are Alamo, Tatiana. Keep telling me to hold, then leave desk. Ali told me he couldn't help bc going on break"
4,"@JetBlue aha, ok. Thanks! Was worried there might not be a seat at all :) Will do it at the airport tomorrow then!"
0,@JetBlue that is a stock response. Delays not as frustrating as poor cust serv &amp; being told by 3 ppl to wait &amp; they'd come back but did not.
2,@JetBlue Ricoh Smith at BOS provided oust and service
0,@JetBlue 4 hr delay on flight to JFK via Tampa &amp; worst customer service in San Juan airport. This after app not working all day.

0,@JetBlue what happens when I have a confirmed flight but no seat available during online checkin except for Even More Space upgrades?
0,@JetBlue thanks for the response. Just been waiting for 5 hours and really frustrated. Seems like no one at JetBlue is concerned.
0,@JetBlue Tx for the info. Just don't understand why you couldn't accurately estimate departure time earlier. Weather in ny is fine now.

0,@JetBlue all day
0,@JetBlue how about free wifi on flt 1254 out of PBI to make up for 2.5 hr delay? Treat us right.
0,@JetBlue why is flight 1106 delayed out to NY? Same problem?
2,@JetBlue Is that a guarantee? We'll see about that tomorrow morning when I have to fight for a seat.
0,@JetBlue thanks for the update. 'Preciate it. Hope it gets here. Been delayed 2 days getting back
0,@JetBlue yes. They are working on it. Hoping bag is on the next flight and will deliver home...
0,@JetBlue WELL...my paid tickets have NO assigned seats at all. So essentially I won't be on this flight unless I pay more.
0,@JetBlue If seats aren't guaranteed why do we pay for them? when I called the rep said some other people booked our seats.
4,@JetBlue thank you for the refund of the change fee for a recent flight affected by our bizarre winter. Excellent customer service and focus
0,"@JetBlue yes, please get me the seats we paid for."

2,@JetBlue that wasn't delayed or cabcelled
0,@JetBlue I have to say that JetBlue has officially lost a customer. What a waste of all the points I have too! I am yet to be in a flight..
0,@Jetblue  I will keep on tweeting until your CEO answers and personally apologizes to my wife and the passengers of flight 136. Just Wrong!!
0,@JetBlue I think it's safe to say that after 25 years of loyal #JetBlue flying we are officially DONE. #Byebyejetblue

0,@JetBlue Why are you making it so freaking hard for me to say good things about you??  #jetbluefail http://t.co/v8SB0RBICx
0,"@JetBlue Seriously, what is your solution? Who exactly will help my 5 year old if there's a problem with the plane? http://t.co/vPDRPLXj5a"
0,@JetBlue Your scheduling skills failed. The delay went from four hours to nearly six. Don't tell me you were snowbound in PBI.
2,@jetblue the man sitting next 2 me at the terminal has a scent tht i cant quite put my finger on. pls dnt let him sit by me on the flight.
0,"@JetBlue sadly, no! I have the app, but it also is experiencing difficulties. The flight information boards are keeping me updated."
0,@JetBlue This is absurd. Should a stranger help my kids if there's a problem? #jetblue http://t.co/LAiGgef9Kj
2,@JetBlue I have a disabled seat in row 6 do I get to board earlier?

0,@JetBlue you're lucky we're still flying you after today's landing gear failure. Get your act together and help us sit with our kids!
0,@JetBlue so the prefference option is not something that you honor? So why having it as one of the services if not applied?
0,"@JetBlue if you want to be helpful, find us a seat. Don't quote terms and conditions. #jetbluefail"
0,@JetBlue do you REALLY think it's okay to sit kids away from parents?! Srsly?! Esp after your landing gear failure?? http://t.co/x6SYW3MDVu
0,"@JetBlue they absolutely guaranteed us we would sit with our kids. Your ""terms"" response is insulting.  #jetblue"
2,@JetBlue flight 1025 JFK to TPA 8:05am on Saturday! One way ticket!
0,@JetBlue What's your excuse this time for 1117 delay from LGA to TPA? I know the plane is in the air.

0,@JetBlue kids fly. Don't hire people who don't care about them. This guy. #jetblue http://t.co/clvlhfgUZw
0,@JetBlue I shouldn't be made to feel like a criminal because I want to sit near my 5 year old on a flight. #jetblue http://t.co/qgtCao1J2U
0,"@JetBlue Usually I have such a great experience with you guys? Very, very unhappy with you right now."

0,"@JetBlue what's up? Three delays so far, resulting in over three hours of unnecessary, extra waiting."
4,"@JetBlue For the record, that was less than a 10-minute turnaround time for the answer from the question.  JetBlue rocks!"

0,"@JetBlue from San Diego with a 4 hour delay to JFK!Even you have a Amex  JetBlue, even having over 50.000 travel miles, you're still nothing"

0,@JetBlue Third straight time that my flight has been delayed flying with you guys. This will be my last trip with you.
0,"@JetBlue you've let me down. 2:15 delay at JFK because of inbound flight from Syracuse, really? #ishouldhavedriven"
0,@JetBlue a 5 year old can't sit alone on a flight. This is absurd. And this guy is a dick. #jetblue http://t.co/2HXsDP0ha4

0,@USAirways is it ok for a flight attendant to talk nasty about passengers while they go get drinks by the restroom? I was shocked listening
4,@USAirways good work by flight 1798 crew.  #Chairman's recognition even in coach.  Too many #missedupgrades Late Flightly.  What's up with this?
0,@USAirways changed our flight 6 times in 1 trip. Bumped to @Delta now &amp; having great experience. Never. Flying. US Air again. Never.
0,@USAirways I can't wait to never fly with you again. Always delayed. Always lose my bag. Rudest people on the planet. Southwest is the best
2,@USAirways I sent email to customer.relations@aa.com. Will this work?
0,@USAirways sat on the ramp for 45 min and missed my connection. No one seems to concerned at usairways.

0,@USAirways i have been patient.. especially the first time. i will never fly with you again
0,@USAirways seriously? Every flight I have had the past 2 days has been delayed. Every single one. Terrible
0,@USAirways I just want to be heard and to discuss the many issues on my trip
0,@USAirways what's up with flight 5545 no gate agent or plane at PHX B18?  Nice customer service.
0,@USAirways very embarrassing.
0,@USAirways Iâ€™m still disappointed that it is apparently ok for a Flight Attendant who isnâ€™t up on current policy to argue with a traveler.
0,@USAirways yes I know the industry procedure on baggage. Thanks for helping..... ðŸ˜‰ what about the impossible connection that started this?
0,@USAirways I agree but per the captain this issue happened before boarding &amp; we all sat in the plane for almost 2 hrs
0,@USAirways and despite tailwindâ€¦ Will still be Late Flight.

0,@USAirways  I will never fly us airways again.
0,@USAirways strikes again--Late Flight crew #3/4 for the trip and maintenance #2/4.  Worth the extra $200/trip for less hassle and fewer delays
2,"@USAirways Can you follow, so I can DM you?"
0,@USAirways so I get bumped to the 6pm to Birmingham which is now delayed because the pilots scheduled don't have enough hours together. Fail
0,"@USAirways yes, thanks but took forever"
0,@USAirways as far as being delayed goesâ€¦ Looks like tailwinds are going to make up for it. Good news!
0,@USAirways horrible travel day w/ your airlines. My 2:20 flight to Birmingham was Cancelled Flightled w/ no notification so I couldn't get on the 4:05
0,"@USAirways I asked if that was SOP, and they said â€œIt is now.â€ But yet the other 11 flights, nothing. Is this a policy or not?"
2,"@USAirways while Iâ€™m askingâ€¦ 2 of my 11 non upgraded flights, Attendants came &amp; greeted me &amp; thanked me for my business b/c I was Exec Plat."
0,@USAirways 24 hrs of traveling and this just welcomes u back home to the US. 4 hr layover and I get to watch it going to wrong destination.

0,@USAirways Are you not even going to acknowledge that you bumped me from a flight (NOT BECAUSE OF WEATHER I AM IN ARIZONA)

0,"@USAirways US 728 pilot started the flight by announcing arrival into Gatwick, not Heathrow. Moments of concern for all aboard."
0,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: no one around to close said door. More strange. Now we're not hearing from pilot for long periods.

2,@USAirways US 728 stated their issues as: kept plane on ground to allow connecting passengers from other flight to board. Fine. Understand.
0,"@USAirways can I speak to a human with some compassion? I wrote an email to discuss my experience and received a generic ""sorry"" email back"
0,"@USAirways take a look at 1715. All F seats filled, so someone upgraded their friend instead of following rules."
0,@USAirways back in line at terminal because phone guy couldn't help.  One person in front of me 20 min wait again? http://t.co/HQHdAD7fvK

0,@USAirways going to miss my connection due to another tarmac delay - on US5268 then 4050 - need a flight home today please!
0,"@USAirways, I'm expecting 400% reimbursement for the unprofessional decisions with US728 on 21 Feb. Check your very full complaint box."

0,"@USAirways I would happily wait in the terminal near food, restrooms and non irritated passengers."
0,@USAirways why let passengers on board when there was an issue? Over an hour &amp; the pilot doesn't know when we'll leave.
0,@USAirways anyone there to help? Still on hold...
0,@USAirways oh yay! Now gate agents decide not to deal with upgrade list and just bump up whoever is closest.

0,@USAirways Why did you put my luggage on the plane after mine? Then not deliver it to me like you said? Now show the claim as closed online?
0,@USAirways takes my money at once but then requires 7 to 10 days to process a refund? Why does your auto attendant hang up? #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways how long for a reply
2,@USAirways Bag policy says stroller OR car seat.  We need to bring 2 car seats and 1 stroller.  Should I just call for details?

0,@USAirways Not only did u lose the flight plan! Now ur flight crew is FAA timed out! Thx for havin us sit on the tarmac for an hr! #Pathetic
0,@USAirways I've been on hold for 75 minutes waiting to talk to someone about my flight tomorrow. Is there another number to call?

0,@USAirways How the heck does one get the Internet desk to authorize a waiver? Would that involved being on hold for another hour?
0,@USAirways so am I supposed to discuss this matter with a computer? #BadCustomerService #Airlines #DividendRewards
0,"@USAirways &gt;250k miles on usair.  Last four flights not good. Other airlines much improved. Billing issues, seats, legroom, in air service."

2,@USAirways No worries I was able to read @stephenrodrick entire book while holding. #TheMagicalStranger

0,"@USAirways 2133. Flight now Cancelled Flightled. Have been rebooked on 2pm flight. If on time take off, I'll have spent 5 extra hours at DCA."
0,"@USAirways We've been sitting on this plane for almost an hour, waiting for it to be fueled. Shouldn't that have been done b4 we got on????"
4,@USAirways Thank you
0,@USAirways can I get a free mimosa to compensate my flight delay (yet again) thx
4,@USAirways Reservation agent on the phone did a great job.
0,"@USAirways get ur act together, start treating ur passengers w/ kinder, have more sanitized planes. Take a page from @Delta perhaps."
0,@USAirways is a joke. Stop losing my luggage!
2,@USAirways can I book using some sort of breavement program? I need to get home for my pops funeral
0,"@USAirways I've been on hold for 35 mins to sort out my reservation out of sync message when trying to check in, what's wrong?!?"
2,@USAirways Thank you. But I donâ€™t understand. What will you do with my feedback?
0,"@USAirways has no idea what customer service means.  As the customer, if you mess up my plans, don't treat me like its no big deal!"
0,@USAirways Still on hold. 1 hour and 45 minutes and counting. Platinum? Who cares? Problems checking in? Who cares?
0,@USAirways how about a little help for the two gate agents trying to rebook flight 1707?
0,@USAirways I respect the stress of a merger but one rep to reschedule/replane 15 ppl who are already Late Flight? #youcandobetter
0,"@USAirways now I am on flight to FLL, and told to take a train back to PBI to get my car. There are no trains to PBI!"
0,"@USAirways I fly quite a bit, and it's not difficult to communicate. If agents let people know what's happening, arrangements can be made"
0,"@USAirways Handled on the phone. Unfortunately it wiped out an entire trip, which is why I'm so displeased."
0,@USAirways headed to NYC from CLT. Funny to hear all phones ring at once and then the entire plane groan (has happened twice more).
4,@USAirways made it!!! Send Bloody Mary's to row 27!!!
2,"@USAirways 5223 out of Gainesville, FL"
0,@USAirways I already let them know and sent 4 complaints.  Got a call back finally when I was asleep and there is no return call back #
2,@USAirways Thank you for valuing my feedback. What will you do with it?
0,@USAirways the flights weren't from this morning... It was 4 flights 2 on Thursday and 2 on Monday which turned into Tuesday
0,@USAirways I spoke with a customer service rep who was rude and curt and transferred me to eternal hold. Sad. #badservice #mergerdisaster
0,@USAirways your customer service is a nightmare. I have been on hold for 1 hour. I'm a platinum member with AA and feel like it's worthless
0,"@USAirways never let's me down, every. Single. Flight. Gets delayed."

2,@USAirways made it.. Never ran so fast in my life
0,@USAirways I've been standing on a very crowded bus for the past 30 mins for DCA-PIT. HELP! @AmericanAir http://t.co/jasKYPLWt5
0,"@USAirways Thanks, but you can't. My flight was Cancelled Flightled for ""maintenance"" reasons, and the next available flight was too Late Flight for me."
0,"@USAirways yes, I was rebooked the next day (Weds). Thanks. Just upset that I lost 2 additional work days AND paid for my own hotel. #losing"
2,@USAirways call Gate D9 in CLT and get me on this flight
0,@USAirways suppose I need to tweet everyone how horrible your airline is for you to take notice. Let me try that route.
0,"@USAirways 835, fix this ASAP"
0,"@USAirways No. Just felt that you could do better in making the emails feel a little less of â€œWe donâ€™t care. Weâ€™re automated."""
0,"@USAirways @AmericanAir , you Cancelled Flightled my flight back during the holidays and gave me a refund of $8.51/ticket from PHL to EWR, really?!"
0,@USAirways I'm logged into a Flight Booking Problems. I need to add API before travelling to the states but I cannot see where to do it
4,@USAirways thanks for helping with #reFlight Booking Problems #Cancelled Flightedflight Yvonne Anthony.  You will help us get to Tel Aviv on time.  #HappyFriday
4,@USAirways big thanks to Yvonne Anthony from the Chairman's desk.  Top tier customer service today.  #outstanding #service &amp; #support.
0,@USAirways now the plane is 100 degrees and we are burning up. This is completely illegal.
0,@USAirways are you fucking kidding me??? http://t.co/qjLzrYWFj2
0,@USAirways now siting on Tarmac in philly for another 15 minutes. This is so lame. Sorry doesn't help. This is terrible.
0,@USAirways what is the damn delay????
0,@USAirways it would be nice to just pull up to the gate. Still sitting here
0,@usairways app is the worst one for airlines. Can't do anything once your original flight time has gone by. Useless.
0,@USAirways has completely wasted my work day! Thank you for the bad service and bad Friday!
0,"@USAirways And also, it's great that you tweet @ complainers, but what about the in-person help when I need it? Robyn F. in Manch = useless."
0,.@USAirways You'll be receiving a long &amp; detailed complaint letter soon. Long story short: never flying USAir again.
0,"@Usairways thanks for making miss connection, getting rebooked, missing that too, and a miserable day. Started my day @ 4:30am for nothing!"
0,"@Usairways need to learn operations. Sit a plane overnight at #gsp, and not realize there's a mech problem. Then delay flight 3 1/2 hours!"
0,"@USAirways that the flight was delayed &amp; closed the doors only to tell us we would not be leaving for an hour and a half. Bad, bad service"
0,@USAirways why would you not give us the option to get off the plane instead of sit on it for an hour and a half when you knew at the gate
0,@USAirways He overflowed over the armrest and under with legs sprawled. You should refund me I had no Choice. #Grossedout
4,@USAirways I appreciate your prompt response.
0,@USAirways nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay for Choice
0,@USAirways well we should have been told that before we were sitting on the plane for an hour to have the option of not getting on.
0,@USAirways I did not want to hang out on your plane all day when I am traveling to get work done and turn right back around. Unacceptable
0,@USAirways doesn't seem likely bc your team failed to scan my bag in LAX and you recycle bagtag numbers that doesn't help #usairwaysfail
0,@USAirways this is a complete waste of my day. A trip to my for work has now turned into sitting on your planes all day. Ridiculous
0,@USAirways we should have been given the option to get off the plane not sit on it for a time longer than our actually flight.
0,@USAirways the plane is moving and it's no ice. We are moving to the end of the runway to sit because LGA has one runway open.
2,@USAirways of course weather was a joke 43 beats 5 degrees in PHL! â›„ï¸â˜€ï¸
0,@USAirways  nothing was available. Male flight crew was not nice/dismissive. Big guy was standby and probably didn't even pay.
0,@USAirways is setting themselves up for a lawsuit. No way we should sit on a plane for an hour and a half.
4,@USAirways Thks US #1786 2/19 PHL to FLL. Overall 1st class has improved with more food now on PHL to FLL and most crews are super.
0,@USAirways I want to not sit on a plane from DCA to LGA for an hour and a half which is longer than my flight.
0,@USAirways this is so unacceptable. I'm going for the day. Now most of my day will be sitting on your plane. Not to mention there is no air
0,@USAirways is moving the plane to the end of the runway for us to sit on it for an hour and a half. They didn't even let us off.
0,@USAirways hi is there somebody avail who can help .....with an refund ? its unbelievable on the phone w US for more than 7 hrs in 4 days
0,@USAirways Plus a US Airways - you need to do something about this! I left Philly to thaw out!!!! http://t.co/pKy7ZhnNRH
0,@USAirways ordered a Scotch &amp; water and F/A asked if I wanted full glass or half? 60 yrs old and first time ever asked that????
0,"@USAirways yeah, the mark was like a mile back. Also we're an hour Late Flight. So thanks a ton for the great service today."
0,@USAirways we got 1 drink then F/A sat in jump seat doing crosswords. Glasses picked up at landing. Just a very lazy service 4 First class.
0,"@USAirways Paid for a Choice Seat my Choice is to NOT have big man next to me in my seat, too. #oldseatnocushion #worstflight #nohelponboard"
0,@USAirways First class no snack basket was catered so drinks only No preflight drink or coathanging 1st drink service 50 min after take off
0,"@USAirways you told us last night that there was a ground stop at O'Hare FOUR HOURS AFTER Obama landed, stop blaming someone else"
0,@USAirways #428 delayed due to #frozentoilet #medicalissue #mechanicalissue #dispatchissue We've heard it all! #LetsGo
0,"@USAirways ""Able""? Does that mean not having private conversations and not helping those w/ luggage that won't fit overhead?"
2,@USAirways 1826 trying to make a connection to Punta Cana leave PHL at 9:50
0,@USAirways is the worst. 45 minute delay in Boston. Not weather reLate Flightd. Going to miss our connecting flight. Gassing up the plane issue.
0,@USAirways is the worst!! Still haven't left.. Everyone missing connections.
0,@USAirways today's flight to Philadelphia.  It's a little disappointing for the unnecessary delays and it's not even snowing in FL.
0,@USAirways I have been trying to book a flight using my miles for 3 straight days. 210 min on phone - still haven't talked to a human.
2,@USAirways can you help me reroute my trip?
0,@USAirways gonna miss connecting flight.. Delayed flying out of Boston
2,@USAirways @AmericanAir I'm in the #finalstretch to #chairman #execplat #mileagerun for 6k needed any suggestions? #letsgo!

4,@USAirways thank you for refunding me on my baggage ! really appreciate it
0,@USAirways thanks for taking my flight off the board AND NOT PROVIDING and updates about my flight which is 26 minutes Late Flight.
4,@USAirways @AmericanAir I am so going to miss US Airways.  You always provided great service and NEVER LET ME DOWN.
0,@USAirways NEVER AGAIN! Worse experience in my life. http://t.co/3dDQq0gQni
0,.@USAirways I rebooked myself - but Cancelled Flighting flight because crew expired after boarding is unacceptable. You started delaying at 1:30pm.
0,"@USAirways 7+ hrs stranded in DCA...zero apologies and the worst customer service. Been a faithful traveler for 15+ years, but no more!"
0,@USAirways this response doesn't correct the fact that your pilot failed to keep passengers updated
0,@USAirways been at DCA at 5 pm still here at 3 am due to mechanical issues and lack of snacks on the plane! Absolutely worse experience!
0,"@USAirways it was 1838, almost 5 hours Late Flight due  to mechanical."
0,"@USAirways never flying #USAirways again. Horrible experience, terrible customer service."
2,@USAirways Mobile boarding pass email.
4,@USAirways we will...sunday! Just a few days away
2,@USAirways I am following you now
0,@USAirways unacceptable. You knew the pilot wouldn't be able to complete the trip. Wasted all of our time.
0,@USAirways I have been on three planes for flight 1907 and still haven't left the ground BAD SERVICE #sad
0,@USAirways Then told to offload because the captain was over hours? This has been a terrible experience.
0,"@USAirways Why were we loaded onto the plane (4 hours Late Flight, mind you), made to sit for 40 minutes"
0,@USAirways why load us on the flight if the captain was over the hours he could fly in one consecutive period? Unacceptable.
0,@USAirways offloading the plane?!?!?! This is ridiculous!!!!
4,"â€œ@USAirways: @jdbwaffles We're excited to have you fly with us, JB! When will this be?â€ Spring Break !!!"
2,@USAirways still just sitting here. nobody has said anything. What's up?
0,@USAirways that is actually not true! You can get a seat online after a big hassle. That policy is totally dishonest and misleading. #FAA
4,@USAirways I will. Thank you for at least tweeting me back:) better than most. ðŸ‘Œ
0,@USAirways that seems unlikely without a crew here to board us
0,"@USAirways that's incorrect. Four people, last flight of the night, with our bags. #horriblecustomerservice"
4,@USAirways Exicted to be flying with y'all soon !!
2,@USAirways and that you can choose the same seat for free after clicking 100 buttons.
0,"@USAirways the fact that you are making customers pay $15 to ""choose"" a seat and try to convince them using psychological tricks with colors"
0,@USAirways Iâ€™ll do that in addition to reviewing on my blog. Your agents were pleasant but the experience was less than :/
0,@USAirways your new seat assignment service is an embarrassment to airlines and customers worldwide. #shameonyou #usairwayssucks
0,@USAirways worst experience ever with you guysâ€¦see my blog tomorrow on my experience. Maybe you can help make it better.
0,@USAirways now the freezing bus is just doing circles?
0,"@USAirways please explain, I have plenty of time since I'm STRANDED!!"
0,"@USAirways I doubt that, its 11:21p &amp; we r still being held captive on the ground at DCA! A little communication from up front would b nice."
0,@USAirways why does it cost $900 to change a $100 ticket when it only cost $150 to purchase a new ticket?
0,@USAirways 3935. Sitting on a freezing bus because nobody is in the plane. What is up?
0,@USAirways we already spoke to someone several times about the matter and no one is sympathetic or will fly us home early complimentary.
0,@USAirways doesn't want me to get home
0,"@USAirways They don't stand alone for me, I bought tix based on USAir confirmed flight. What good is confirmation if you change it anyway?"
0,"@USAirways DCA-&gt;HPN, u r prof hostage takers.We stood on bus 2 plane for 25 min,now sitting on plane with no mvmt &amp; 1 announcement 4 &gt; hour!"
0,"@USAirways - I bet you don't, but I'm the paying customer here. I know how to check for flight delays, thank you."
0,"@USAirways I can't even use my return flight home because the change fees you charge are too expensive, forcing me to purchase a new ticket."
0,@USAirways oh great after a 5 hour delay we get to sit on the plane for another hour without it moving.  Flight 1137 has been awful
0,@USAirways that's the 1st sorry I received from your company. The least you could do is fly us home early at no extra charge.
0,@USAirways never flying with you guys again. Extremely disorganized and too many delays.
0,"@USAirways my buddies are currently delayed 3.5 hours and counting in DCA on their ways to CAE for a golf week, any compensation? #FlyDelta"
0,"@USAirways Flights 890 was the delay, Flight 5136 was my missed connectionâ€¦ Help!"
0,@USAirways the flight that I did not connect to was 1857.
0,@USAirways even when I do simple google search by flight number it tells me which gate so won't be that difficult am sure #disappointed
0,@USAirways yes .not sure how you guys don't know gate is occupied and keep us waiting
0,"@USAirways Wow! Your miles program is Ripoff,Quick ticket fee 75$ I hope you all end up on unemployment."
0,@USAirways - BOS -&gt; DCA delayed again. This needs to stop. I will be filing complaints with the FAA and Consumer Affairs
0,@USAirways sitting on the Tarmac waiting to deplane 40+ minutes. The level of service I've come to expect.
0,@USAirways you gladly take the loyal customer's money but when you cause an inconvenience you do nothing to help fix the problem you caused.
0,@USAirways the least you could do is make up for what you have caused. You are ruining people's memories! You should be ashamed!
0,"@USAirways 1st a Late Flight plane, then missing flight crew, then maintenance problems, gates switched 4 times. You call this customer service??"
0,"@USAirways due to your expensive change fees either. Out of all the airlines, we chose yours, all do you could screw us. STRANDED!! No help!"
0,"@USAirways we can't afford the international change fees to rebook our trip so we wanted to go home, turns out we can't afford to go home."
2,"@USAirways but it's not their fault, because their policy says they at least got us to our destination. Really?"
0,"@USAirways ruined our honeymoon by causing us to miss our international flight, and now we are stranded."
4,@USAirways FA attendant on 4553 PHL to PWM tonight was fab!  An asset to your team.  From 1F. Have a great night team!

0,@USAirways flight 728 from PHL to London has been sitting on the tarmac for 46min w/NO further update from the pilot. what gives???
0,"@USAirways I already HAVE, four times"
0,"@USAirways 42 minutes holding. Seriously, if your average wait time is over 30 minutes then maybe, just maybe, you're understaffed."
0,@USAirways I submitted refund request b4 1st flight 2 days ago. Is that all I need 2 do?
4,"@USAirways I know that, thanks. Evaluate further ;-) ... -Chairman"
0,"@USAirways Seriously??? I have shared my concerns four times already, to NO avail!  Geeeeezzzzz! #frustrated flyer"
0,@USAirways No hot food on a 5 hour flight? Crazy. Couldn't eat in PHL b/c our original connection was 40 min Late Flight. What gives? #PHLtoLAS
0,"@USAirways Seriously, flight delay Cinci to Philly due to new ground staff, miss connection to MAN UK and now have to argue for hotel. WTF"
0,@USAirways thank you for continuing to be the worst airline out. Didn't need that extra hour of sleep after 29 hours of travel anyway

0,"@USAirways flight 1777 has been waiting for 30 minutes at RSW waiting for weight balance clearance. Come on, let us leave!"
0,"@USAirways @AskPayPal When will it be marked ""completed"". I'm scared I'm going to lose my reservation or my money is going to be refunded."
0,"@USAirways @AskPayPal completed. If that's the case then why does it still say ""in progress"" on Paypal's website. I reserved on the 13th."
2,@USAirways @AskPayPal So I contacted my bank. They took the money out today. I also contacted @USAirways they said my reservation is

2,@USAirways we got our bags today. Thanks!
0,@USAirways 45 min hold time then a hang up by Manager Mike in dividend miles dept. tough to justify sticking with the Us air CC and status.
0,@USAirways never fails to disappoint.
0,@USAirways platinum flyer bought tkt in AA. Also both accounts are linked. So WHY can't I check in for flight tomorrow?
0,@UsAirways  your person taking tickets is rude and now we are delayed 4-50 minutes because you overfilled fuel on the plane #500.
0,"@USAirways flight 500 out of Seattle has 10,000lbs too much fuel and no water for the lavoratories. Nice job guys - est 40min behind now"

4,@USAirways I miss you too. Work has taken me out of Philly. Iâ€™ve been on flight 1776 from BOS â€”&gt; PHL so many times I should have a res. seat
2,"@USAirways http://t.co/AXRYeIWzh0, vuelo24.es, vuelos24.es sell too cheap MAD-NYC with USAirways. Are they trusted webs or is it a scam?"
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir Total lack of cust. service for a mom flying solo w. baby. Will not be flying w. Am. Air again!!!
0,@USAirways pure anarchy on flight 555 to SLC. People walking in with nothing packed in bags with arms full of stuff. #getittogether
0,@USAirways @AmericanAir you know...hockey sticks are expensive. Your baggage handlers shouldn't just be throwing them on the cart.
4,@USAirways no problem.  Things worked out at airport.   Thanks!
2,@USAirways any word on whether or not flight 1971 from Seattle to Charlotte will have connections held? Or...
2,@USAirways please change direct flights from RIC to JFK instead of LGA. Pleeeeease! LGA is the pits.
0,@USAirways i tried it but doesnt help very much and Reservation seems to be overwhelmed with some issues
0,@USAirways should take a lesson from @SouthwestAir and wait for passengers from connecting flights. Shame..
2,@USAirways Do you have a phone Nbr for Refund Dept ?

4,"@USAirways yes, it's a domestic flight. Thank you!"

4,@USAirways thanks.  If you have another method also that would be nice.  Appears to be a design flaw
0,@USAirways yes.  Every one of these on every flight is like this.  There needs to be more Velcro or something
0,@USAirways please secure the 'footrest' shelf' in business class on A330 airplanes!!! http://t.co/ZL4bVEXmcJ
0,@USAirways forgetting to fuel up? Realizing there was more cargo to add to plane? One way to try and mask a delay.
0,"@USAirways Your gate team are polite. But your planes are habitually Late Flight. In many cases, passengers are waiting for the flight crew!"

0,@USAirways why are you letting us go to the runway if there are mechanical problems. #wewantcomps
0,@USAirways WTF is going on with the 1:30 from DC to BOS? Twice we go back back to the gate after leaving for the runway? Total BS.

0,@USAirways oh the irony. A dog who will not spot barking in waiting area is now right in front of me! Please send me a cocktail coupon stat
2,@USAirways @AmericanAir when is US Air switching to AA iOS app? AA app is much better.
2,"@USAirways a $75 change is ok most of the time but if there r open seats on earlier flt and no chkd bag, why not let someone fly standby?"
4,"@USAirways thanks to the gate agent in State College, PA that was able to get me on an earlier flight AND figure out an earlier connection!"

0,@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I donâ€™t accept the change it wonâ€™t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
0,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"

0,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
2,"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
2,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
2,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
2,@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
2,@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
4,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
0,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...

0,@AmericanAir worst company ever please do not fly with them I repeat please do not fly !! They will not credit you if you're delayed
0,"@AmericanAir continues to win: I've never missed a flight before, but a nice little quiet gate change made it possible. Sheesh."
4,@AmericanAir - keeping AA up in the Air! My crew chief cousin Alex Espinosa in DFW! http://t.co/0HXLNvZknP
0,"@AmericanAir lost my cats, missed their flights, kept them crated 30 hrs for a  would-be 5 hr trip. You'll never touch my pets again."
0,@AmericanAir don't worry you won't steal my money again
0,@AmericanAir why am I continually getting put on hold by painfully inexperienced people when calling your Platinum desk?!
0,@AmericanAir pretty lame response to a two paged single spaced letter http://t.co/aCebo6ELPa

4,@AmericanAir awesome. Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir my flight 386 to Dallas from Jacksonville fl has been Cancelled Flightled. No one has notified me. What's going on?
0,@AmericanAir extremely upset that your baggage handlers decide to go in my luggage and take my belongings
0,"@AmericanAir flight 65 delayed over 4 hours on 2/22, had no GF meals despite my early request, attendant seat fell on my leg #badservice"
0,"@AmericanAir but, what I can always rely on when I fly USAir or American is that employees will be rude and unhappy."
0,@AmericanAir robocalls me with another Cancelled Flightation. And then when I donâ€™t accept the change it wonâ€™t let me connect to an agent. Just wow.
0,"@AmericanAir said that AA does not provide in-flight wifi on the routes to China based on some federal laws, but United does, why is that?"
0,"@AmericanAir Right. But more than two hours Late Flight, and it seems due to poor communication, which sounded like it was annoying on-plane staff"
0,@AmericanAir I'm not sure what happened to my USAirways status when the merger took place.
0,@AmericanAir can u help rebook passenger via Twitter/DM.  Been on hold for 1.5 hours. Thanks!
0,"@AmericanAir I'd like to apologize to the gate agent for flight AA76, I was not aware that zone 1 was after the nine other precious gems."
2,@AmericanAir my key point of confusion is whether I can make this change even though the initial Flight Booking Problems was on US Airways metal?
2,@AmericanAir origin/destination/dates are the same. Going from US Airways connecting flight to AA direct flight. Award is saver level.
2,@AmericanAir When will the old 777-200 fly ORD-PVG get upgraded?
2,@AmericanAir I know. Just a little cold weather humor. :)
0,@AmericanAir None of the #LAX flights into #DFW have been Cancelled Flightled. Those landing before and after ours are fine. Completely arbitrary.
0,@AmericanAir that doesn't really answer my question. Maybe if I provide more details you can give me clarification...
0,@AmericanAir this delayed bag was for my friend Lisa Pafe. She got her bag after 3 days in Costa Rica. Issue no updates on your system.

0,@AmericanAir I lost my (basket) ballbag on your plane
4,@AmericanAir thanks for the great customer service. Family made it back to SAT safely. The weather at DFW made things a little worrisome.
0,@AmericanAir She seems a little preoccupied - that's why I'm bringing it to your attention. I am just flagging an issue as an observer.
0,"@AmericanAir She was at gate on time though, they made her cry, and made a scene for 10 mins instead of boarding her. Plane still outside."
0,"@AmericanAir Disappointing lack of kindness toward this person. The agent asked her counterparts ""why this person was talking to her""."

2,@americanair One question.. my wife didn't get the bonus. Should I call about it today?
0,"@AmericanAir but not sufficiently sorry to actually *do* anything about it, I guess. Your systems are presumably beyond reproach or reform."
2,@AmericanAir Good morning!  Wondering why my pre-TSA check was not on my boarding pass this morning??
2,@AmericanAir  Yes I do bit you don't follow me so I can't DM you
0,@AmericanAir as your flight attendants are an extension of your brand - bitchy flight attendants on 5:30 am flights are not appreciated.

0,@AmericanAir How do I place it on hold and complete payment? I don't see any way to do that from my reservations page.
0,@AmericanAir Bad weather happens. But not being able to get through to a reservations rep for over 6 hours is just crazy. #frustrated
2,@AmericanAir Flight Get Me Out Of Chicago.
0,@AmericanAir why are customer svc reps unable to handle calls. Is there a 24hrs Cancelled Flightlation policy? Booked yesterday need to Cancelled Flight
0,@AmericanAir Bad weather is understandable but your own pilot said that over 160 people called out and that ZERO bags are on the plane.
0,"@AmericanAir yep,filed a claim at Heathrow yesterday. We were promised a call this morning with an update, but got nothing."
0,@AmericanAir why is does it seem to be impossible to contact anyone at your airline to get an item left on board a plane 5 min after deplane
0,@AmericanAir you flew me into Chi instead and I got a ride to MKE. U said my bags would go to MKE today. Is it on the Cancelled Flightled flight tho?
0,@AmericanAir stuck at gate Miami to JFK flight 1510. Are we going to get out of here tonight? Very frustrating
0,@AmericanAir I understand they're busy &amp; doing their best. My frustration is an automated call changing my flight w/o allowing me to talk
0,@AmericanAir HELP U said ud chnge our retrn flght since we missed our connection Sat &amp; now ur not pickng up the phone.Only hve 18 hrs left!
0,@AmericanAir has been almost a month and still no response to my online complaint/questions. Out $300 because of it.
0,@AmericanAir bad weather happens but lack of preparation is inexcusable. Depending on good weather is not a good business model.
0,@AmericanAir how is US4623 going to be on time when they are still deplaning at 4:08? This is BS.
2,"@AmericanAir so, what should he do next exactly?!"
4,@AmericanAir Flight for tomorrow was Cancelled Flightled. New one booked. Seats taken care of. Just a tweet to commend you all on the service. Thanks!
0,@AmericanAir instead they yelled at him and told him to call a number that will not pick up due to call volume
0,@AmericanAir he is at the Boston airport. There is a problem. The agents will not honor the voucher because one number is rubbed out.
2,@AmericanAir See photo of B787 scale model &amp; our PN 320008A wheel deflator specified in Chapter 32 of B787 AMM. http://t.co/kfD4WQRkLW

0,@AmericanAir Can't help now as all seats have been taken.  There has to be a way to handle high volume of call days.

4,@AmericanAir Delaney and Shawn at DFW showed exceptional customer service today. Will happily choose AA whenever possible now! Thank you!
0,@AmericanAir Another customer non service from you. If we waited for you to solve the problem we would miss the funeral. You suck!

0,"@AmericanAir why can't you hire a staff that is helpful, informed and nice to it's customers?"
0,@AmericanAir from the rude ticket counter employees to forcing my wife on standby and then pushing her down the list.. it was a very bad day
0,"@AmericanAir Agents in DFW were very kind did their best to help, but this doesn't make up for PHX error and attitude! #Americant"

4,@AmericanAir thanks. Delivery status??
0,@AmericanAir I don't believe it's acceptable to have a ticket # changed after check in time &amp; not be notified. Apparently that's standard.
0,"@AmericanAir I need to complain to AA, but the email form field doesn't allow enough characters for my complaint. Have a real email address?"
0,@AmericanAir our flight AA 1338 is delayed out of Providenciales and will be missing our connection AA 1651 in Miami to SEA. Who do we call?

0,@AmericanAir We don't mind the fee! We were told we can't change name on ticket at all.
4,@AmericanAir Thank you!!!! I will be there to pick her up on time.
0,"@AmericanAir the original receipt lists my flight cost as $89ish, and doesn't reflect the use of a voucher"
2,@AmericanAir so whats the hold up on flight 4302?
4,"@AmericanAir Well, you guys are totally kicking a million pounds of ass. Bar none, the best SM team in the airline industry in my opinion."
0,@AmericanAir Least you could do would be to refund me the one-way ticket I had to buy since you weren't able to accommodate. Thank you.
0,"@AmericanAir After being patient about my ""delayed"" bags for 5 weeks, I was told that it could take another 3 to 5 weeks. Unacceptable!"
0,@AmericanAir I had to purchase a ticket that I never would have had to buy had the flight not been Cancelled Flightled. Terrible customer service.
0,"@AmericanAir flt 703, sorry scheduled at 545, phl-mia, a totally chaotic, poorly addressed event.  Sent to three gates in the night"
0,@AmericanAir Was told you could only refund me the cost of my original return flight (note: flight you had booked for me was more expensive)
0,"@AmericanAir Not okay. Since you couldn't put me on an earlier flight, I had to buy my own ticket on another airline."
0,"@AmericanAir Heard back at 7:30 am today, was put on flight tomorrow AM, arriving home at 4 pm. Meaning I'd have to take a 2nd day off work."

0,"@AmericanAir Was put on hold for 5.5 hrs then got a call back at 11:20 pm, only to wait on hold for another hour."
0,@AmericanAir You lost a customer today. Flight today was Cancelled Flightled and I had to find out by calling customer service yesterday.
0,"@AmericanAir Just called regarding my bag, came in yesterday and no one notified more or updated the online record locator #customerservice"
0,@AmericanAir to realize your customer service leaves much to be desired and the folks handling the calls could care less...and it shows.
4,@AmericanAir thanks
0,@AmericanAir unacceptable. It's clear losing just one customer doesn't matter to American but how many more bankruptcies will it take
0,@AmericanAir will do on another airline that's more accommodating of its customers. Unable to simply change passengers with notice is simply
2,@AmericanAir is there a probability that flight 1330 from DFW to DTW will be delayed or Cancelled Flighted?

4,@AmericanAir thank you. They are processing my refund.
0,"@AmericanAir That's good, I'd expect that but I can't get through on the phone to make any changes. Can I change it online?"
0,"@AmericanAir ; @USAirways US 728/Feb 21. Unprofessional, unprepared, unsympathetic, lacked communication, and lacked solutions."
4,"@AmericanAir Thanks for asking On second plane after maintenance issue, for flight from ORD to LIT. Sitting at gate in very very warm plane"

0,"@AmericanAir just Cancelled Flightled my 7 am flight tomorrow with out informing me at all today, then booked one in 2 days, and no customer service"
0,"@AmericanAir Thanks - I note some, but not all, flights are Cancelled Flightled - are only some aircraft/runways working out of DFW today/tomorrow?"
0,@AmericanAir we knew it was not going to leave but we had 6 hours waiting... that was the hurry..

0,@AmericanAir they don't even give an option to hold.. Just say lines are busy Plz try Late Flightr
0,@AmericanAir i will be writing a very detailed letter to you all about this experience today. I have never experienced such awful cs ever
0,"@AmericanAir The delay is nothing but the personnel being so combative up to the point of saying ""what's the hury,  the plane is not leaving"
0,@AmericanAir delta rerouted 6 of my bags onto aa977 MIA-CUR. How can I see if they made it onto the flight?
0,@AmericanAir would have been nice if the agents were at the very least courteous since the delay was AA's fault
2,@AmericanAir Your logo looks like 3D glasses.
0,@AmericanAir no private msg me and will provide details...u really need customer svc training for your staff
0,@AmericanAir and let FLT 2350 know I'm coming / gate crew have yet to arrive to let us off FLT 5350 #DFW

0,@AmericanAir @Expedia are killing me. Over 3 hours to get NO human to help me.

0,@AmericanAir - where are my bags? Baggage claim C25 or C26 (flt# 959)?? I can see the plane from here? Why does it take 25 min???
0,"@AmericanAir is there only one call centre? I know it's busy right now, really need to speak to agent not computer"
0,@AmericanAir you guys fail again.. all I need to do is use my voucher for a ticket but I can't do it online #yourphonesystemsucks

4,@AmericanAir hats off to Admiral Lounge attendant @ YYZ Terminal 3 who gave her banana to our toddler when none avail elsewhere.
0,"@AmericanAir ""We'll drop off your luggage 24 hours after your flight"" is ridiculous."
2,@AmericanAir thanks. Bummer. Poor planning on my part. I assume the card in Passbook won't work either?
0,"@AmericanAir You should be more timely with bags that missed a flight, people need their undies the next morning!"
4,@AmericanAir I tried that. They won't book us with another airline. I wish I had flown with you! We are now stuck in FL til Weds.
2,@AmericanAir  A true #AmericanView ...The National Mall http://t.co/N7ExdbcRHg
0,"@vanessaannz seriously, you hate @AmericanAir since they can't accommodate you due to inclemental  weather disruptions? lol, very funny"

0,@AmericanAir was told at 7pm my bags would 1000% be at my house by 9pm. Well they're not and I continue to be lied to.
0,@AmericanAir won't answer the reservation line!  Nice service.  We may be stuck...
0,@AmericanAir It's not your agents; it's your voice activated system that's not working right. And no email on Cancelled Flightlation. Lots of problems
0,"@AmericanAir I was on flt 2222 tomorrow, they moved me to 750. I need it moved to Tuesday. the roads won't be better for flight 750. thanks"
2,@AmericanAir I'm on #1058 tmrw from CUN DFW. Final dest'n is ORD. Seeing freezing rain in DFW all morning. Should I change my connection?

0,@AmericanAir I am trying to add my tsa pre check number to my reservation online and don't see an option to do that..?? #nosecuritylines
0,@AmericanAir you have the poorest trained employees at these desks. I haven't even started to discuss the #lostluggage yet
0,@AmericanAir none of your sample itineraries can actually be booked http://t.co/mF7rABGn8a Every last leg back to US says invalid
4,@AmericanAir I'm booked for Tuesday night. 60 degrees in Alabama right now. I'm good. Stay warm and safe.
0,@AmericanAir So plot thickens. We're on plane but no ground crew to get us off gate. Apparently under the weather in large numbers....
0,@AmericanAir  800 number will not even let you wait for next customer rep. Very frustrating. Can't talk to humans.
0,@AmericanAir what happened?? We didn't get a notification about a departure Cancelled Flightation tomorrow. Why will it take 2 hrs to talk to someone
2,@AmericanAir you set a schedule try and keep it !!! #AAALWAYSLate Flight
0,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , to my surprise  BA doesn't  have  me registered in the system , I was getting hopeful :(, Lets step it up , Okay ?"

4,"@AmericanAir Thanks for the reply, but a functioning plane four hours ago was the only way to do that. The staff was friendly, tho."

0,@AmericanAir that's the number I called -it wouldn't let me speak to an agent because of the issues with weather today
0,@AmericanAir usually raving about the service to LAX. Your nbr1 and helper can't figure out how to hang a coat and serve a drink. 6F
0,"@AmericanAir @MO3TVida just so you know, reservations team has a 2+ hr callback time"
2,@AmericanAir what do kids aged 11 and 12 need to fly with AA internally within the usa. Thanks for confirming
0,@AmericanAir absolute terrible service to schedule a 40 minute layover and then not let someone on the plane with the door not closed.
0,"@AmericanAir I didn't miss my flight.  American Airlines gave my ticket, as well as 6 other passengers tickets away. Not my fault."
2,@AmericanAir Please help AA 2258 Monday Cancelled Flightled.  Can you advise on reFlight Booking Problems / refund.  Have children and need to make plans now
2,@AmericanAir DM sent. Answer me please
0,"@AmericanAir I really want to get home. Tonight, preferably. Please stop delaying my plane ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜•ðŸ˜¦ #AmericanAirlines"
0,@AmericanAir is profiting in the billions and throwing crap at the people who put them there. American is a hurting brand
0,@AmericanAir I've never witnessed such covert tactics from an airline.
0,@AmericanAir you Cancelled Flightled my wife's flight and she has to call but your service won't even let us. Going on 7 hours now.
0,@AmericanAir it shouldn't happen but did and has put us and our gear in jeopardy. What steps do you take to protect customers if their items
2,@AmericanAir American Airlines.
0,@AmericanAir all of these issues are not based on weather or things that are out of your control. These  issues are based on negligence.
0,@AmericanAir the worst air experience I have ever had and I am not in the first plane yet.
2,@AmericanAir I just DMed you
2,@AmericanAir why is it most first class passengers now request the sand which from coach ?
4,@AmericanAir @DAI_President Good luck at DFW this evening AA!
0,@AmericanAir so we have a Cancelled Flightled flight in about twelve hours. Maybe we'll have heard from an AA rep at that point.
0,"@AmericanAir on hold for 3 hours...got an agent, immediately txfd me to change cncdld flight...told it would be 1 min, 80 min Late Flightr, waiting"
4,@AmericanAir Awesome customer service on #390 from rdu. They snuck my wife a warm cookie. Thx!
0,@AmericanAir flight attendants on AA2402 were spectacular.Fed the ENTIRE cabin then food from coach. Why do you keep serving this vile food
0,"@AmericanAir @CineDrones I just wish that a team member would pick up the phone at this point, let alone be courteous or helpful ðŸ˜³"
0,"@americanair seriously, pls pls bring more people up to help us! There are still flights to ORD frm DFW and I want in http://t.co/o3CjsVSsqF"

0,@AmericanAir approaching three hours sitting in the plane on the ground at DFW on #AmericanAirlines flight 3056 - Oscar performance
0,"@AmericanAir - We have; they were useless. Baggage service called before 9 to tell us we would have bags by 3. Now, maybe midnight."
2,@AmericanAir checking into a flight on your website is about as easy as asking a bear to shit in a toilet #justsaying
0,@AmericanAir makes some small improvements and retains their program they win all. They keep the crappy food and change advantage they lose
0,@AmericanAir AA 2258 why have you Cancelled Flightled our flight without courtesy of notifying us or alternatives?  Very poor.
0,@AmericanAir how have you not loaded our luggage on the plane and were OVER an hour delayed? #Flight293
0,@AmericanAir I spent $600 on my flight. Could have gone on @united for $382 but their mileage program sucks.
0,"@americanair Plz bring more agents up to DFW AA Cstmr srvc ctr gates A, there are only 2 agents and 100+ ppl... http://t.co/uCvEU2hurZ"
0,@AmericanAir the food served on AA2402 was vile and gross.The entire cabin did not eat their meal. Survey the flight crew. Another gross out
0,@AmericanAir the bags arent even loaded on the plane??? #Flight293
0,@AmericanAir never got an update and we had the worst communication from u. Our flight delay was mechanical and not a word. #poorservice
0,"@AmericanAir looks like I have. Best I can hope for I guess. It's on us air, so I don't think I'll get miles on Alaska. Which sucks."
0,@AmericanAir my #Navy sisters flight 2470 cancld. She can't get an agent. They've called her back to be put on hold &amp; then discnct.Any help?
0,@AmericanAir My wife &amp; infant daughter are on AA3195 ABI-DFW. En route but delayed. Can yâ€™all hold AA1458 to RDU so they can connect?
2,@AmericanAir Educate Bohol is a 501(c)(3) w/all volunteer staff. I can help the kids or buy a plane ticket--I can't do both. Can you help?
0,@americanair anxious to see how you all care for customers youâ€™ve inconvenienced #Cancelled Flightledflight
0,"@AmericanAir also the problem is not calling us at all. Other airlines send an automatic call and email, and they rebook as a courtesy."
0,"@AmericanAir Why can't you handle your customers needs? Cancelled Flightled flight, 800 number leads to a quick ""Goodbye"" Very Sad!"
0,@AmericanAir VERY upset that I cannot select seats for Tuesday flight online or over the phone. Terrible customer service :( Please help!
2,"@AmericanAir I need to get from Albuquerque, NM, USA, to Cebu, Philippines. I'm providing educational help for 800 kids. Can you help me?"
0,@AmericanAir already did &amp; an automated voice told us to wait 2 hours. They have yet to call back.
0,@AmericanAir you changed my AAdvantage travel plans &amp; I called 800-433-7300 to get help but it sea ur too busy &amp; hangs up on me. What gives?
0,"@AmericanAir yes, for tomorrow at 9 am. But I have to work though ðŸ˜’ I'm really mad about the situation"

0,@AmericanAir  flight from DFW to LIT tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled.  What do I do next?  Pls advise.  #HELP
0,@AmericanAir how can you not be taking calls? I need to change my flight!
0,@AmericanAir my flight I have reserved for tomorrow has been Cancelled Flightled. Can I Cancelled Flight my reservation and get a full refund?
4,@AmericanAir thanks to FA Shawn for spectacular service on FLT 79 LHRDFW and to FA Susan for such a warm engaging onboard welcome
0,@AmericanAir I can't choose a seat online because I booked on @priceline ??? #SMH
0,@AmericanAir it wasn't really about the delay. It was more about being told the engine needed to be troubleshot.  Makes a person paranoid.
0,"@AmericanAir ""overweight"" flight = you sold more tickets than you had seats. We all know that. Let's call it what it is."
2,"@AmericanAir @jaynegelman How,about more@Blacklist too!!"
0,@AmericanAir at JFK flight to Boston delayed 20 min waiting for catering they are boarding flight to LAX waiting for over and hour WTF?
0,"@AmericanAir Yes, it says my reservation cannot be retrieved at this time. Also I never got an email from AA saying my flight was Cancelled Flightled."
0,@AmericanAir Can you help with my Cancelled Flightled flight -- I'd like to book another flight...I've been on hold for 95 minutes and counting....

4,"@AmericanAir that's ok, thanks for letting me know. Appreciate all the responses."
0,@AmericanAir spoke too soon. 30 min Late Flightr still waiting for bags to load. Some sympathy would be appreciated at the very least.
2,@AmericanAir @HeyMyNameIsSEAN Sean if you look at the AA schedule it sometimes gives you a clue if new'airplanes are used. They are gr8
4,@AmericanAir thanks for the show! ðŸ‘
0,"@AmericanAir well done, you have taken the fun out of air travel @PHLAirport"
4,@AmericanAir no worries even though I was talking about seat assignment :)
2,"@AmericanAir @kconti44 This looks like JFK - had a great pic of the OneWorld jets lined up on the opposite side #Air Berlin, LAN and AA."
0,"@AmericanAir Been trying to call all day, get hung up on every time. Your guys are horrible!"
0,"@AmericanAir @jameswester see, James, we only have 7 dedicated inbound phone lines because telephones eat into our billions in profits"
2,@AmericanAir @superyan I did hear a last call for boarding of this flight when I was at JFK a few hours ago. good luck w/flights!
0,"@AmericanAir , sitting on plane for 2.5hrs at gate due to computer sys issue, at what point do you Cancelled Flight a flight?, ridiculous @PHLAirport"
0,@AmericanAir @cjdjpdx not a valid response in 2015 for a multinational corp whose profits are measured in billions. Stop understaffing!
2,"@AmericanAir Yo, could that be a catering truck before mine eyes?  Unmoving? http://t.co/ASW6QwUf1Z"
0,@AmericanAir @kaps12 this is an international airline that experienced record profits last quarter. But they can't staff a call center
4,@AmericanAir Great seats on this aircraft!
0,Is rudeness and poor customers service a job requirement at @AmericanAir ? Been waiting 28hrs and still haven't even seen one planeðŸ˜¡
2,@AmericanAir Both pictures taken at the same time but which is right? #totallyconfused http://t.co/dvSLtQZKmQ
0,@AmericanAir AA919 flight attendant freaks out and leaves aircraft as passengers react to a 24h delay and cattle treatment. Surreal!
2,@AmericanAir 901 #Miami to #Rio to participate at @RCM_Oficial representing @CisnerosMedia #yourstoryhere
0,@AmericanAir a worker just checked for ice on our plane using his cell phone flashlight! Really?! Come on!
2,@AmericanAir @cyncyn661 Are you now flying 763s to Madrid from JFK or is this DFW/ORD? Huge !!
0,@AmericanAir The wine served in USAirways flights are watered down somehow right out of the bottles.
2,@AmericanAir who's your pick for best picture? I don't want to board your airline until I know
0,@AmericanAir we have 3 more passengers with me   There are two more reservation numbers
0,"@AmericanAir @PatrichRuben no, profit maximization is your top priority. Nothing else even registers for you dinosaurs"
2,@AmericanAir 8:30 departure?  Sure. Is there a catering strike at JFK?  @FoxNews @CNBC @BloombergRadio http://t.co/HPgXYZRW8o
2,"@AmericanAir @derekc21 , so what would be a file number that works , needs to be 10 characters , email me derek.austin@century21.ca  easier"
0,"@AmericanAir @manuel_c ""here for you"" as in, yeah, we'll tweet platitudes at you so you'll think our Twitter bot cares? Or...."
0,@AmericanAir #flight293 was supposed to depart at 745 and at 815 we still have not boarded.
0,@AmericanAir You have the worst customer service of any airlines I've ever encountered. Flat out awful
0,"@AmericanAir @ezemanalyst why don't you tweet canned, impersonal responses as though this is the only impatient customer you've got"
4,@AmericanAir DONE!! thank you so much!!
0,@AmericanAir Nice AA employee making skillful excuses about Late Flightness due to catering snafu... http://t.co/YPVPVdlTYs
0,@AmericanAir then taxi across dfw airport for 20 min to then state 75 min past departing from gate that we need deiced? Wow. Uncool &amp; untrue
0,@AmericanAir 24 hrs &amp; 2 cncld flights Late Flightr I've landed in PHL. Now 30 mins &amp; counting on tarmac waiting for gate. Pls do better than this.
0,"@AmericanAir delivered mom's delayed bag to the wrong place. 2 hrs on hold yesterday, &gt;1 hr today. Still no bag. #AA http://t.co/QKkJdFObOS"
0,"@AmericanAir Yeah, try harder. No catering truck in sight.  Can we just leave now w/o the food won't eat anyway?"
0,@AmericanAir this is awful customer service.
4,@AmericanAir everything's good now brothaaaaaa
0,@AmericanAir its pulling away from gate to get your departure time then leaving us on tarmac claiming power issues that magically repaired
2,@AmericanAir 740pm wheels up to be exact.  I'm sending a DM.
0,@AmericanAir @sarahzou translation: we don't reinvest our mammoth profits into the customer service experience. 'Cause we don't care.
0,@AmericanAir OMG ANSWER YOUR PHONE I HAVE BEEN ON HOLD FOR 1.5 hours. Cancelled FlightED FLIGHTS SUCK
0,@AmericanAir we are through. I can quit you. I am. The nonsense &amp; lies are a colossal infringement you can no longer get away with
0,"@AmericanAir 719. Looks like we are about to get going, finally!"
0,"@AmericanAir @JimDayTV no, you couldn't care less. That's why their customer service is run by bots"
0,@AmericanAir pls tell me how to get a person on the phone asap

2,@AmericanAir you wont allow calls? My husband has a ticket but it looks like all the seats are taken? I cant even call.
0,@AmericanAir yes but we HAVE TO GET HOME TOMORROW!!!! Please
0,@AmericanAir unfriendly unhelpful agents. Unannounced gate changes. Delayed flight that we found out about by word of mouth
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 still sitting at DFW waiting for baggage to be loaded
0,@AmericanAir I tried several times to select seats. The only ones ever available would've cost me $30 extra per seat.
0,@AmericanAir we need a miracle @slcairport please help flight 1228 get out of here by 640 #FingersCrossed #pleasegod #missmykids
2,@AmericanAir 3198 to AEX. Is it still going?
0,@AmericanAir i do not want to stay overnight at this airport! I have been here since 11 am this morning!
0,@AmericanAir finally about to take off! Thanks for the customer service by the g8 reps @ c17 @ CTL. Any idea what caused the system failure?
0,@AmericanAir Trying to rebook a flight with you because of Cancelled Flightlation is a nightmare.  I was hung up on once. Can you help me rebook?
0,"@AmericanAir i have tried getting help from agents, the phone, twitter, and FB. Can no one at American Airlines help me?"
0,@AmericanAir Close down
4,@AmericanAir it was 1265 coming and next catching 2396 home to DCA. Let's get another great leg too tonight!
4,@AmericanAir i appreciate your apology. Sincerely. Thank you. That's really all I ever wanted to begin with.
0,@AmericanAir AA 100 - good job overselling this flight. Delayed 90 minutes to deplane the overflow passengers' bags.
0,@AmericanAir Iâ€™ve been on the line waiting for 40 minutes again.
0,@AmericanAir you know nothing about customer service and I'll make sure everyone knows it
0,@AmericanAir I understand flight Cancelled Flightation but not being able to get through to change that flight for 6 hrs is not acceptable.
0,@AmericanAir now I have to pay for a hotel a car ride miss classes which I pay 30k for and miss work and you tell me to talk to someone
0,@AmericanAir your 1800 kept hanging up on me and made me miss a second flight
0,@AmericanAir yeah that's not helping. Having my bag shipped to the correct city the first time probably would have helped.
0,@AmericanAir I did 50 times and no one was helpful I'm missing work nd school nd the manager REM from mia told me he didn't want to talk us
0,@AmericanAir My flight to @dfwairport was Cancelled Flightled. Mess ensued. Please thank the awesome Marcos (Concierge Key @ GRU) for sorting it out!
0,@AmericanAir I haven't been rebooked. I called and left my number for a callback but haven't heard anything and my flight is tomorrow. :(
0,@AmericanAir not enough push crews for JFK = 1.5 he delay and counting....
0,@AmericanAir I cannot believe how long flight 759 PHI  is taking. I know it's US Airways but you own it. I would really like to get home.
0,@AmericanAir Hopefully you guys are willing to cover my lovely car rental and living charges...I love being here for two extra days..
0,@AmericanAir Same as yesterday's Cancelled Flighted flight. AA104. Your customer support is just awful!
0,@AmericanAir big surprise flight 2330 is delayed. Hopefully not for 6 hours like our flight here.  Thanks again for a sleepless night.
0,@AmericanAir really? Not even worthy of a response. This is beginning of a social media alert to the world that AA and @USAirways are useles
0,@AmericanAir Hi AA friends! My sis's flight AA362 DFW&gt;&gt;MKE was Cancelled Flighted due to weather. Any way you can help here? What are her options?
0,@AmericanAir is that something the crew on the current leg can request of the gate team on the next leg?
0,@AmericanAir I have not. There's no option for even getting a call back!
0,@AmericanAir tomorrows flight Cancelled Flighted. I understand. Three hour wait for a call back and now 60 minutes on hold. Not cool.
0,@AmericanAir all flights Cancelled Flighted tomorrow and that means I'm stranded at the airport for the night... wow.
0,@AmericanAir how hard is it to have catering ready to go?
0,@AmericanAir Why does your iPhone app not have any sort of notifications option?
0,@AmericanAir this is unbelievable and unacceptable. Flight #293. JFK. Everyone at the gate is upset as most of us have been here all day.
0,"@AmericanAir I made my flight but then still had no update emails when I landed, no info ever sent on that or second flight. Losing my biz."
0,@AmericanAir flight 3056 DFW still has all passengers sitting on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded - still waiting
0,@AmericanAir I still am not on a flight. Ive been here allll day and now we're not boarding because we're waiting for catering?
0,@AmericanAir my husband and 5 year old son stuck overnight in DC thanks to 7 crew members arguing over who was boarding the flight
0,@AmericanAir if this is how you guys work then i will never fly with you guys again.
4,"@AmericanAir versus @JetBlue 
in Customer Service?
Who will win!
For Me @AmericanAir is a convenience to a trip to Cali &lt;3"
